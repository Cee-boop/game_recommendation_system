Directed by Hidetaka Miyazaki, with world-building contributions from novelist George R. R. Martin, the game features an expansive open world called the Lands Between. Players assume the role of a customisable character known as the Tarnished, who must explore this world, battle formidable enemies, and seek to restore the Elden Ring to become the Elden Lord.

The game builds on the challenging gameplay mechanics familiar from the Dark Souls series but introduces a more open-ended structure with vast exploration, dynamic weather, and a day-night cycle. It offers deep lore, complex characters, and an interconnected world filled with secrets, dungeons, and powerful bosses. Elden Ring takes place in the Lands Between, a fictional realm over which several demigods rule. It was previously ruled over by the immortal Queen Marika, who acted as keeper of the Elden Ring, a powerful force that manifested itself as the physical concept of order. When Marika shattered the Elden Ring and disappeared, her demigod children began fighting over pieces of the Ring in an event called The Shattering. Each demigod has a shard of the Ring called a Great Rune, which corrupts them with power. In the game, the player character is a Tarnished, one of a group of exiles from the Lands Between who are summoned back after the Shattering. The player must traverse the realm to repair the Elden Ring and become the Elden Lord.",challenge gameplay mechanic familiar demigod child fight elden,elden action rpg develop fromsoftware publish bandai namco entertainment release february direct hidetaka miyazaki worldbuilding contribution novelist george martin game feature expansive land player assume role customisable character tarnished explore battle formidable enemy seek restore elden elden lord game build challenging gameplay mechanic familiar dark souls series introduce openended structure vast exploration dynamic weather daynight cycle offer deep lore complex character interconnected secret dungeon powerful boss elden land fictional realm demigod rule rule immortal queen marika keeper elden powerful force manifest physical concept marika shatter elden disappear demigod child fight piece event shattering demigod shard rune corrupt power game player character tarnished exile land summon shatter player traverse realm repair elden elden lord

The first and second playthroughs follow the respective views of 2B and 9S during an initial invasion. After opening a route for future missions, they are sent to clear out machine threats for the Resistance, led by Anemone, who provides the two with support. During their missions, 2B and 9S discover that the machines are exploring human societies and concepts. The two work with a pacifist machine group led by Pascal; battle Adam and Eve, physical manifestations of the machine network who reveal that their creators were destroyed centuries ago and encounter A2, a rogue android on the run from YoRHa. Adam is killed by 2B after he captures 9S. During his recuperation, 9S discovers a glitch in YoRHa's servers when syncing himself and 2B, and learns that humanity was extinct long before the alien invasion. Their last remnant is a Moon-based server holding humanity's incomplete genome remains. YoRHa perpetuates the myth of their survival to maintain morale and give androids a ""god"" to fight for. With Adam dead, Eve goes mad with grief and drives the machines under his command into a frenzy. 2B and 9S kill Eve to end the rampage, but 9S becomes infected with Eve's logic virus, forcing 2B to kill him. However, 9S's consciousness survives within the local machine network.

The third playthrough begins as YoRHa launches a full-scale invasion. A logic virus attack—enabled by the ""glitch"" that 9S previously discovered—corrupts every YoRHa unit including those in the Bunker, except for 2B and the restored 9S. 2B and 9S are separated in the aftermath, and 2B is infected with the logic virus. Discovered by A2, 2B uploads her memories into her sword and asks her to look after 9S. An ignorant 9S witnesses A2 mercifully killing 2B and swears revenge on her. Simultaneously, a tower created by the machines rises from the land, separating the two before they can fight. The perspective splits between A2 and 9S a fortnight after these events. A2—the survivor of a test run for YoRHa—finds herself empathising with the machines; she witnesses Pascal's village being destroyed, then its ""children"" committing suicide out of fear when attacked. Pascal begs A2 to either wipe his memory or kill him; A2 can perform either task or leave him. An increasingly-unbalanced 9S investigates the tower's resource-gathering platforms, fighting machine remnants and learning the tower is designed to launch a missile at the Moon server. Both eventually enter the tower, with Devola and Popola sacrificing themselves to open it.",discover corrupts yorha unit include ignorant witness mercifully kill logic virus attack enable base server hold humanity pacifist machine lead,nier automaton story android battle reclaim machinedriven dystopia overrun powerful machine playthroughs follow respective view initial invasion route future mission send machine threat resistance lead anemone provide support mission discover machine explore human society concepts pacifist machine lead pascal battle adam eve physical manifestation machine network reveal creator destroy century encounter rogue android yorha adam kill capture recuperation discover glitch yorha server sync learn humanity extinct alien invasion remnant moonbased server hold humanity incomplete genome remain yorha perpetuate myth survival maintain morale android god fight adam dead eve mad grief drive machine command frenzy kill eve rampage infect eve logic virus force kill consciousness survives local machine network playthrough yorha launch fullscale invasion logic virus attack--enabled glitch discovered--corrupts yorha unit include bunker restored separate aftermath infect logic virus discover upload memory sword ignorant witness mercifully kill swears revenge simultaneously tower create machine rise land separate fight perspective split fortnight event a--the survivor yorha--finds empathise machine witness pascal village destroy child commit suicide fear attack pascal begs wipe memory kill perform task leave increasinglyunbalanced investigate tower resourcegathering platform fight machine remnant learn tower design launch missile moon server eventually enter tower devola popola sacrifice

Released in March 2016, it is the fourth entry in the Souls series and the final instalment in the Dark Souls trilogy. Set in the decaying kingdom of Lothric, players take on the role of the ""Ashen One,"" an undead warrior tasked with rekindling the First Flame to prevent the world from falling into darkness.

The game features challenging combat, intricate level design, and a deep, lore-rich narrative. Set in the Kingdom of Lothric, a bell has rung to signal that the First Flame, responsible for maintaining the Age of Fire, is dying out. As has happened many times before, the coming of the Age of Dark produces the undead: cursed beings that rise after death. The Age of Fire can be prolonged by linking the fire, a ritual in which great lords and heroes sacrifice their souls to rekindle the First Flame. However, Prince Lothric, the chosen linker for this age, abandoned his duty and decided to watch the flame die from afar. The bell is the last hope for the Age of Fire, resurrecting previous Lords of Cinder (heroes who linked the flame in past ages) to attempt to link the fire again; however, all but one Lord shirk their duty. Meanwhile, Sulyvahn, a sorcerer from the Painted World of Ariandel, wrongfully proclaims himself Pontiff and seizes power over Irithyll of the Boreal Valley and the returning Anor Londo cathedral from Dark Souls as a tyrant.

The Ashen One, an Undead who failed to become a Lord of Cinder and thus called an Unkindled, rises and must link the fire by returning Prince Lothric and the defiant Lords of Cinder to their thrones in Firelink Shrine. The Lords include the Abyss Watchers, a legion of warriors sworn by the Old Wolf's Blood which linked their souls into one to protect the land from the Abyss and ultimately locked in an endless battle between each other; Yhorm the Giant, who sacrificed his life for a nation conquered by his ancestor; and Aldrich, who became a Lord of Cinder despite his ravenous appetite for both men and gods. Lothric was raised to link the First Flame but neglected his duties and chose to watch the fire fade instead.

Once the Ashen One succeeds in returning Lothric and the Lords of Cinder to their thrones, they travel to the ruins of the Kiln of the First Flame. There, they encounter the Soul of Cinder, an amalgamation of all the former Lords of Cinder. Upon defeat, the player can attempt to link the fire or access three other optional endings unlocked by the player's in-game decisions. These include summoning the Fire Keeper to extinguish the flame and begin an age of Dark or killing her in a sudden change of heart. A fourth ending consists of the Ashen One taking the flame for their own, becoming the Lord of Hollows.",return anor londo cathedral game feature challenge combat,dark soul iii action roleplay game develop fromsoftware publish bandai namco entertainment release march fourth entry souls series final instalment dark souls trilogy set decaying kingdom lothric player role ashen undead warrior task rekindle flame prevent fall darkness game feature challenge combat intricate level design deep lorerich narrative set kingdom lothric bell signal flame responsible maintain age die happen time age dark produce undead curse rise death age prolong link ritual lord hero sacrifice soul rekindle flame prince lothric chosen linker age abandon duty decide watch flame die afar bell hope age resurrect previous lord cinder hero link flame age attempt link lord shirk duty sulyvahn sorcerer painted ariandel wrongfully proclaim pontiff seizes power irithyll boreal valley return anor londo cathedral dark soul tyrant ashen undead fail lord cinder unkindled rise link return prince lothric defiant lord cinder throne firelink shrine lord include abyss watchers legion warrior swear wolf blood link soul protect land abyss ultimately lock endless battle yhorm giant sacrifice life nation conquer ancestor aldrich lord cinder ravenous appetite god lothric raise link flame neglect duty choose watch fade ashen succeed return lothric lord cinder throne travel ruin kiln flame encounter soul cinder amalgamation lord cinder defeat player attempt link access optional unlock player ingame decision include summon keeper extinguish flame age dark kill sudden change heart fourth consists ashen flame lord hollow

Continuing with the Norse mythology theme, the game is set in ancient Norway and features series protagonists Kratos, the former Greek God of War, and his young son Atreus. The game kicked off the events of Ragnarök, where Kratos and Atreus must journey to each of the Nine Realms in search of answers as they prepare for the prophesied battle that will end the world. The freezing winds of Fimbulwinter have come to Midgard, making survival for Kratos, Atreus, and Mimir in the Norse wilds even more challenging than before.

While the last game built an enormous amount of trust and understanding between father and son, there is still a great deal of complexity in their interactions – especially after the revelation of Atreus’ Giant heritage and the hidden prophecy only Kratos saw.

Atreus is desperately curious. Like most young people, he wants to understand who he is more than anything. In this case, he wants to understand who he could be. The mystery of Loki’s role in the upcoming conflict is something that Atreus cannot let go of. He wants to keep his family safe, but Atreus also doesn’t want to stand by and do nothing while conflict consumes the Nine Realms.

Kratos, still bearing the knowledge of his past mistakes, wants to spare Atreus the bloody lessons he learned from his conflict with gods. He wants to keep his son safe, above all, and their confrontation with Baldur has vindicated the belief that only tragedy will come from further entanglements with the Aesir.

Together, Kratos and Atreus will have to make a choice about which path they will take. Whatever they choose will define the fate of all those living in the Nine Realms as Ragnarök approaches.",atreus atreus giant heritage feature series protagonist kratos,god war ragnarok ninth installment god war series sequel god war continue norse mythology theme game set ancient norway feature series protagonist kratos greek god war son atreus game kick event ragnarok kratos atreus journey realm search answer prepare prophesied battle freeze wind fimbulwinter midgard survival kratos atreus mimir norse wilds challenging game build enormous trust understanding father son deal complexity interaction revelation atreus giant heritage hidden prophecy kratos atreus desperately curious people understand understand mystery lokis role upcoming conflict atreus family safe atreus stand conflict consume realm kratos bear knowledge mistake spare atreus bloody lesson learn conflict god son safe confrontation baldur vindicate belief tragedy entanglement aesir kratos atreus choice path choose define fate live realm ragnarok approach

Mario has to jump into worlds within paintings ornamenting the walls of Peach's castle, uncover secrets and hidden challenges, and collect golden Power Stars as reward for platforming trials. “Mario, please come to the castle. I've baked a cake for you. Yours truly, Princess Toadstool.”

“Wow, an invitation from Peach! I'll head out right away. I hope she can wait for me!”

Mario is so excited to receive the invitation from the princess, who lives in the Mushroom Castle that he quickly dresses in his best and leaves right away.

“Hmmm, something's not quite right here... It's so quiet...”

Shaking off his uneasy premonition, Mario steps into the silent castle, where he is greeted by the gruff words, “No one's home! Now scram! Bwa, ha, ha.”

The sound seems to come from everywhere.

“Who's there?! I've heard that voice somewhere before...”

Mario begins searching all over the castle. Most of the doors are locked, but finding one open, he peeks inside. Hanging on the wall is the largest painting he has ever seen, and from behind the painting comes the strangest sound that he has ever heard...

“I think I hear someone calling. What secrets does this painting hold?”

Without a second thought, Mario jumps at the painting. As he is drawn into it, another world opens before his very eyes.

Once inside the painting, Mario finds himself in the midst of battling Bob-ombs. According to the Bob-omb Buddies, someone...or something...has suddenly attacked the castle and stolen the “Power Stars.” These stars protect the castle. With the stars in his control, the beast plans to take over the Mushroom Castle.

To help him accomplish this, he plans to convert the residents of the painting world into monsters as well. If nothing is done, all those monsters will soon begin to overflow from inside the painting.

“A plan this maniacal, this cunning...this must be the work of Bowser!”

Princess Toadstool and Toad are missing, too. Bowser must have taken them and sealed them inside the painting. Unless Mario recovers the Power Stars immediately, the inhabitants of this world will become Bowser's army.

“Well, Bowser's not going to get away with it, not as long as I'm around!”

Stolen Power Stars are hidden throughout the painting world. Use your wisdom and strength to recover the Power Stars and restore peace to the Mushroom Castle.

The game uses a 3-button combat system, but with a great number of gadget abilites which Batman can unlock. This makes for a very cinematic combat experience when fighting the Joker's goons. After the Joker assaults Gotham City Hall, he is caught by Batman and taken to Arkham Asylum, which temporarily houses many members of the Joker's gang, who were transferred after a fire at Blackgate Prison. Believing the Joker allowed himself to be captured, Batman accompanies him into the asylum. The Joker's plan is revealed as Harley Quinn takes control of the security and the Joker escapes into the facility, aided by a corrupt guard who kidnaps Commissioner Gordon. The Joker threatens to detonate bombs hidden around Gotham City if anyone tries to enter Arkham, forcing Batman to work alone. Tracking Quinn to the medical facility to rescue Gordon, Batman is exposed to the Scarecrow's fear toxin and hallucinates, seeing Gordon's death and the corpses of his parents talking to him. After fighting off Scarecrow, Batman finds and subdues Quinn before rescuing Gordon. The Joker then directs Batman to the captured Bane, who has been experimented on by asylum doctor Penelope Young. The Joker frees Bane and Batman is forced to fight him, during which Quinn escapes. Afterward, he goes to a secret Batcave installation he had hidden on the island, where Batman restocks his gadgets.

There, Batman learns that the Joker returned to the asylum to gain access to Young, who has been developing Titan—a more powerful version of the Venom drug that gives Bane his strength—intending to use it to help patients survive more strenuous therapies. Young learned that the Joker had been funding her research to create an army of superhuman henchmen; her refusal to hand over the formula precipitated Joker's return to the Asylum. While searching for Young, Batman is again attacked by Scarecrow and the fear toxin, and hallucinates the night of his parents' deaths. After he recovers, Batman destroys Young's Titan formula and rescues Young from Victor Zsasz. An explosion kills Young and the Joker obtains the completed batches of Titan.

At the Penitentiary, Quinn releases Poison Ivy from her cell before being imprisoned by Batman. Quinn accidentally reveals that Joker has a Titan production facility in the Arkham botanical gardens. Batman travels there and learns that Titan is created by genetically modified plants. He enlists Ivy's help to create an antidote and learns that it can only be made from spores found exclusively in Killer Croc's lair in a sewer. En route to Croc, Batman is again attacked by Scarecrow and overcomes several doses of fear toxin. Meanwhile, Joker injects Ivy with Titan, enhancing her powers. Ivy begins ravaging Arkham Island with giant mutant plants. Pursued by Batman into Croc's lair, Scarecrow is attacked by Croc and dragged underwater. Batman recovers the necessary spores and subdues Croc before returning to the Batcave, but can only synthesize one dose of the antidote before Ivy's plants breach the cave and destroy his equipment.

Batman returns to the botanical gardens and defeats Ivy, halting the rampaging plants. The Joker announces that the preparations for his party are finally complete and Batman travels to the asylum's visitor center where the Joker's applauding henchmen welcome him. The Joker reveals he has recaptured Gordon and tries to shoot him with a Titan-filled dart; Batman leaps to Gordon's defense and is shot instead. Batman attempts to resist the change, and an upset Joker takes an overdose of Titan, mutating into a massive monster. In a makeshift arena on the building's roof, the Joker challenges Batman to a fight as Titan-induced monsters in front of news helicopters. Batman refuses to transform, uses the antidote on himself, and defeats the Titan-affected Joker and his henchmen, knocking his nemesis unconscious with an explosive gel-enhanced punch. In the aftermath, those affected by Titan begin to revert to normal, including the Joker—who is restrained and taken into custody as police officers retake the asylum. Batman overhears a call about a crime led by Two-Face in progress and flies back to Gotham City in the Batwing. In a post-credits scene, a crate of Titan formula is shown floating in the ocean near the asylum when a hand surfaces and grabs it.",detonate bomb hide gotham city joker assault gotham city hall ivy ravage arkham island temporarily house harley quinn control quinn release poison ivy,variety gadget island asylum hall joker game button combat gadget abilites batman unlock cinematic combat experience fight joker goon joker assault gotham city hall catch batman arkham asylum temporarily house joker gang transfer blackgate prison joker capture batman accompany asylum joker plan reveal harley quinn control security joker escape facility aid corrupt guard kidnap commissioner gordon joker threaten detonate bomb hide gotham city enter arkham force batman track quinn medical facility rescue gordon batman expose scarecrow fear toxin hallucinate gordon death corps parent talk fight scarecrow batman subdues quinn rescue gordon joker direct batman capture bane experiment asylum doctor penelope joker bane batman force fight quinn escape afterward secret batcave installation hide island batman restock gadget batman learn joker return asylum gain access develop titan--a powerful version venom drug bane strength--intending patient survive strenuous therapy learn joker fund create army superhuman henchman refusal hand formula precipitate joker return asylum search batman attack scarecrow fear toxin hallucinate night parent death recover batman destroys titan formula rescue victor zsasz explosion kill joker complete batch titan penitentiary quinn release poison ivy cell imprison batman quinn accidentally reveal joker titan production facility arkham botanical garden batman travel learn titan create genetically modify plant enlist ivy create antidote learn spore exclusively killer croc lair sewer en route croc batman attack scarecrow overcome dos fear toxin joker injects ivy titan enhance power ivy ravage arkham island giant mutant plant pursue batman croc lair scarecrow attack croc drag underwater batman recover spore subdues croc return batcave synthesize dose antidote ivy plant breach cave destroy equipment batman return botanical garden defeat ivy halt rampaging plant joker preparation party finally complete batman travel asylum visitor center joker applaud henchman joker reveal recapture gordon shoot titanfilled dart batman leap gordon defense shoot batman attempt resist change upset joker overdose titan mutate massive monster makeshift arena building roof joker challenge batman fight titaninduced monster news helicopter batman refuse transform antidote defeat titanaffected joker henchman knock nemesis unconscious explosive gelenhanced punch aftermath affect titan revert normal include joker--who restrain custody police officer retake asylum batman overhear crime lead twoface progress fly gotham city batwing postcredits scene crate titan formula float ocean asylum hand surface grab

For years now, the Shinra Electric Power Company has been providing the world with energy at the expense of the lifestream, the “river” whence all life flows and whither it returns. After storming the company’s headquarters and engaging in a series of battles for the ages, Cloud and his companions leave Midgar behind and set out for the wider world. Once in the grasslands, they hop aboard chocobos and embark on a journey with an unknown destination.

Meanwhile, Zack—beaten and battered from his fight against an army of troopers—hobbles across the wastelands into Midgar with a mako-poisoned Cloud on his shoulder. Though he has managed to escape death for now, the ominous rift in the sky gives him little reason to rejoice.

That is hardly the only threat facing the world, however. The Shinra Resistance Committee, backed by Wutai’s interim government, declares war on the company; figures shrouded in black robes carry with them the corpse of Jenova, a veritable calamity from another world; and the Weapons—fierce and monstrous guardians of the planet—have recently awakened.

The world has now a real-time day and night cycle and various weather effects that influence enemy behaviour, visibility and sound. Sabotaging or destroying certain structures can also influence other parts of the map.

Set inside the heavily fortified walls of a sprawling district in the heart of Gotham City, this highly anticipated sequel introduces a brand-new story that draws together a new all-star cast of classic characters and murderous villains from the Batman universe, as well as a vast range of new and enhanced gameplay features to deliver the ultimate experience as the Dark Knight. At a press conference held by Bruce Wayne to declare his opposition to Arkham City, TYGER mercenaries arrest and imprison him in Arkham City. Hugo Strange discloses his knowledge of Wayne's dual identity as Batman before releasing him into the prison's criminal populace. While Strange prepares to commence ""Protocol 10"", Wayne obtains his equipment via airdrop from Alfred Pennyworth, allowing him to become Batman. He first saves Catwoman from being executed by Two-Face, who hopes to gain respect by murdering her. After Joker attempts to assassinate Catwoman, Batman tracks him to his hideout in the Sionis Steelmill, believing Joker may know the truth behind Protocol 10.

There, Batman learns that the unstable properties of the Titan formula are mutating in Joker's blood, gradually killing him. Joker captures Batman and performs a blood transfusion on him, infecting him with the same fatal disease. Joker also reveals that Gotham hospitals have been poisoned with his infected blood. Desperate to save himself and innocent citizens, Batman seeks out Mr. Freeze, who had been developing a cure but has since been kidnapped by the Penguin.

Tracking Penguin to the Cyrus Pinkney National History Institute, Batman defeats his forces, his imprisoned monster Solomon Grundy, and ultimately the Penguin himself, before liberating Mr. Freeze. Freeze tells Batman that he has already developed the cure, but its instability renders it useless. Batman deduces that the restorative properties of Ra's al Ghul's blood can complete the cure. Batman tracks one of Ra's al Ghul's assassins to his underground lair, leading Batman into a confrontation with Ra's and his daughter Talia, Batman's former lover. With Ra's al Ghul's blood, Freeze is able to develop an antidote, but it is stolen by Harley Quinn before Batman can use it.

When he returns to the Joker, Batman finds him restored to health. While the two fight, Strange activates Protocol 10, which is revealed to be a scheme to wipe out the entire population of Arkham City and destroy the criminal element of Gotham. The TYGER troops begin executing inmates as Strange launches missile strikes on Arkham's denizens from his base in Wonder Tower. A missile hits the steelmill, burying Batman under rubble. Before Joker can take advantage of the situation, Talia arrives and offers him immortality in exchange for sparing Batman's life. After escaping with the help of Catwoman, Batman is convinced by Alfred to end Protocol 10 before pursuing Talia and Joker.

Batman infiltrates Wonder Tower and disables Protocol 10. Ra's al Ghul is revealed to be the true mastermind behind Arkham City and mortally wounds Strange for failing to defeat Batman. With his dying breath, Strange activates ""Protocol 11"", the self-destruction of Wonder Tower. Batman and Ra's escape, but Ra's commits suicide rather than risk capture. Joker contacts Batman, threatening to kill Talia unless Batman meets him at the Monarch Theater. Once Batman arrives, Joker demands the cure but is stabbed and apparently killed by Talia while distracted. Talia admits to stealing the cure from Quinn, when she is killed by a second Joker, still stricken with the disease. The healthy Joker that Talia stabbed then reanimates into the shapeshifting Clayface, who is revealed to have been masquerading as a healthy Joker all along at the ailing villain's request.

Batman incapacitates Clayface, but Joker blows up the theater floor, sending Batman plummeting into Ra's' lair below. Batman destroys Ra's' rejuvenating Lazarus Pit before the Joker can use it, and drinks a portion of the antidote. Batman debates curing his foe but is attacked by Joker before he can act, causing the antidote vial to inadvertently smash. Batman admits that in spite of everything Joker had done, he would have saved him. After Joker finally succumbs to his illness and dies, Batman carries his body out of Arkham City. As Commissioner Gordon asks what happened, Batman places Joker's body on the hood of a police car and leaves in silence.",cyrus pinkney national history institute tyger troop execute inmate true mastermind arkham city kill talia batman meet protocol wayne obtains imprison monster solomon grundy highly anticipate sequel introduces truth protocol joker strange launch missile strike strange activates protocol arkham city build,batman arkham city build intense atmospheric foundation batman arkham asylum send player soar arkham city maximum security gotham city thugs gangster insane criminal mastermind set heavily fortified wall sprawling district heart gotham city highly anticipated sequel introduce brandnew story draw allstar cast classic character murderous villain batman universe vast range enhanced gameplay feature deliver ultimate experience dark knight press conference hold bruce wayne declare opposition arkham city tyger mercenary arrest imprison arkham city hugo strange disclose knowledge wayne dual identity batman release prison criminal populace strange prepares commence protocol wayne equipment airdrop alfred pennyworth batman save catwoman execute twoface hop gain respect murder joker attempt assassinate catwoman batman track hideout sionis steelmill joker truth protocol batman learn unstable property titan formula mutate joker blood gradually kill joker capture batman perform blood transfusion infect fatal disease joker reveal gotham hospital poison infected blood desperate save innocent citizen batman seek freeze develop cure kidnap penguin track penguin cyrus pinkney national history institute batman defeat force imprisoned monster solomon grundy ultimately penguin liberate freeze freeze batman develop cure instability render useless batman deduces restorative property ra ghul blood complete cure batman track ra ghul assassin underground lair lead batman confrontation ra daughter talia batman lover ra ghul blood freeze develop antidote steal harley quinn batman return joker batman restore health fight strange activates protocol reveal scheme wipe entire population arkham city destroy criminal element gotham tyger troop execute inmate strange launch missile strike arkham denizen base tower missile hit steelmill bury batman rubble joker advantage situation talia arrives offer immortality exchange spar batman life escape catwoman batman convince alfred protocol pursue talia joker batman infiltrate tower disables protocol ra ghul reveal true mastermind arkham city mortally wound strange fail defeat batman die breath strange activate protocol selfdestruction tower batman ra escape ra commits suicide risk capture joker contact batman threaten kill talia batman meet monarch theater batman arrive joker demand cure stab kill talia distract talia admits steal cure quinn kill joker stricken disease healthy joker talia stab reanimate shapeshifting clayface reveal masquerade healthy joker ail villain request batman incapacitate clayface joker blow theater floor send batman plummet ra lair batman destroy ra rejuvenate lazarus pit joker drink portion antidote batman debate cure foe attack joker antidote vial inadvertently smash batman admit spite joker save joker finally succumb illness die batman carry body arkham city commissioner gordon happen batman joker body hood police car leave silence

The game is played from a third-person perspective and its world is navigated on-foot or by vehicle. Throughout the single-player mode, players play as Niko Bellic. An online multiplayer mode is included with the game, allowing up to 32 players to engage in both co-operative and competitive gameplay in a recreation of the single-player setting.

Two expansion packs were later released for the game, The Lost and Damned and The Ballad of Gay Tony, which both feature new plots that are interconnected with the main Grand Theft Auto IV storyline, and follow new protagonists. Grand Theft Auto IV follows the story of Niko Bellic, a veteran of an unnamed war in Eastern Europe, who is haunted by the betrayal of his 15 man army unit. Ten years later, after a smuggling run goes bad due to a betrayal from a partner, Niko leaves Eastern Europe to escape the anger of his employer, Ray Bulgarin. After six months in the merchant navy (serving aboard the cargo ship the Platypus), and believing the stories of his cousin Roman, Niko comes to Liberty City to pursue the American Dream as well as searching for the traitor of his unit.

One cloudy night, a lone hawk flies by two longtime companions - Wander and his horse Agro - navigating an unforgiving cliffside path on the edge of a canyon. The two have been traveling for a long time on this offbeat path, through murky forests and wet grasslands alike.

They arrive at last at their destination: a tall stone gate with a narrow passage. On the other side lies an enormous bridge of near-otherworldly construction. The bridge spans over the Forbidden Lands, a dramatic landscape of plains and canyons with enclosed and cut-off environments ranging from arid deserts to clefts with tall geysers to dark forests and murky crevasses.

The bridge finally comes to an end at the Shrine of Worship, a gigantic structure in the middle of the Lands. Wander and Agro make their way to the ground floor and the temple's main hall, which is lined with sixteen stone idols. At the end of the empty hall is an altar. Here it is shown that Wander is carrying something with him: a body wrapped in a cloth sheet. He places the body on the altar and removes the sheet, revealing Mono, a young woman clothed in a white dress.

The game suddenly cuts to a picture of an owl mask amidst a cloudy sky. From here, Lord Emon, a spiritual leader in Wander's society, speaks an esoteric monologue:

That place...began from the resonance of intersecting points...
They are memories replaced by ens and naught and etched into stone.
Blood, young sprouts, sky - and the one with the ability to control beings created from light...
In that world, it is said that if one should wish it, one can bring back the souls of the dead.
But to trespass upon that land is strictly forbidden...
Agro is suddenly frightened by a noise from behind the trio. Several shadowy apparitions are emerging from the temple floor, and Wander sees this and draws a mysterious sword from its sheath, pointing it towards the shadows. The blade emits an otherworldly energy, and the creatures immediately dissolve into thin air. Immediately, a booming pair of voices fill the halls from a great aperture above, surprised that Wander possesses the ""Ancient Sword"". Wander correctly identifies the voices as belonging to Dormin and asks that Mono be revived. Initially, Dormin expresses an indifference towards the matter, but ultimately cannot hide the interest in the sword Wander carries.",strictly forbidden agro,openworld actionadventure game wanderer stolen magical sword steed companion trespass cursed land deal ancient bring sacrificial victim life set fulfill bargain involve track infiltrate abode sixteen colossus sacrifice achieve goal cloudy night lone hawk fly longtime companion wander horse agro navigate unforgiving cliffside path edge canyon travel time offbeat path murky forest wet grassland alike arrive destination tall stone gate narrow passage lie enormous bridge nearotherworldly construction bridge span forbidden land dramatic landscape plain canyon enclosed cutoff environment range arid desert cleft tall geyser dark forest murky crevasses bridge finally shrine worship gigantic structure middle land wander agro ground floor temple main hall sixteen stone idol hall altar wander carry body wrap cloth sheet body altar remove sheet reveal mono woman clothe white dress game suddenly cut picture owl mask cloudy sky lord emon spiritual leader wander society speaks esoteric monologue placebegan resonance intersect memory replace en naught etch stone blood sprout sky ability control create light bring soul dead trespass land strictly forbidden agro suddenly frighten noise trio shadowy apparition emerge temple floor wander draw mysterious sword sheath shadow blade emit otherworldly energy creature dissolve air booming pair voice hall aperture surprise wander possess ancient sword wander correctly identify voice belonging dormin mono revive initially dormin express indifference matter ultimately hide sword wander carry

Four Swords

After the battle, people built a shrine to protect it. Several years later, princess Zelda noticed that Vaati might have escaped from the blade of the Four Sword and asked Link to come to the Four Sword shrine to check with her. As soon as they came there, Vaati captured Zelda and carried her away. Some little fairies later told Link that princess Zelda was at Vaati's palace up on the sky.

In addition to blocks, the environment features plants, mobs, and items. Some activities in the game include mining for ore, fighting hostile mobs, and crafting new blocks and tools by gathering various resources found in the game. The game's open-ended model allows players to create structures, creations, and artwork on various multiplayer servers or their single-player maps. Other features include redstone circuits for logic computations and remote actions, minecarts and tracks, and a mysterious underworld called the Nether. A designated but completely optional goal of the game is to travel to a dimension called the End, and defeat the ender dragon. Bedrock Edition (also known as the Bedrock Version or just Bedrock) refers to the multi-platform family of editions of Minecraft developed by Mojang Studios, Xbox Game Studios, 4J Studios, and SkyBox Labs. Prior to this term, as the engine originated with Pocket Edition, this entire product family was referred to as ""Pocket Edition"", ""MCPE"", or ""Pocket/Windows 10 Edition"".

All Bedrock editions of Minecraft use the title Minecraft with no subtitle. The current version of Bedrock editions is 1.16.0. Before the Better Together Update, they had different subtitles on each platform, including Pocket Edition (for all mobile platforms), Windows 10 Edition, Gear VR Edition, and Fire TV Edition. Xbox One Edition, Nintendo Switch Edition, and PlayStation 4 Edition were originally part of Legacy Console Edition before the Better Together Update, and their features had to be ported to Bedrock Edition. Apple TV Edition was discontinued shortly afterwards, thus it was no longer updated and removed from the App Store on Apple TV devices.

Although all Bedrock versions are nearly identical, the price varies depending on the platform. Approximate prices are listed in USD; Mobile versions cost US$6.99 (€7.99, £6.99, AU$10.99). PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Fire TV cost US$19.99 (€19.99, £16.74, AU$29.95). The Windows 10 and Nintendo Switch versions are the most expensive, costing US$29.99 (€19.99, £16.74, AU$39.95). The Windows 10 version is sold in a Starter Collection or Master Collection, the latter costing US$49.99 (€49.99, £39.99, AU$69.95) and including more DLC and Minecoins.[33] DLC purchased from the Marketplace on one platform is usable on all other platforms, but the game itself is sold separately on each platform. Despite all being UWP apps, Minecraft is sold as 3 separate apps at different prices on Windows 10, Windows 10 Mobile, and Xbox One. (This means that Xbox Live achievements are not shared between these platforms and buying the game on one of these platforms does not get the game on the others. There are sets of achievements for each platform). The Xbox One version is also playable to Xbox Game Pass subscribers.

The narrative centres on Alan Wake, a bestselling thriller novelist experiencing writer's block. He travels to the small town of Bright Falls with his wife, Alice, seeking a change of environment. Shortly after their arrival, Alice vanishes under mysterious circumstances.

As Alan searches for her, he discovers pages of a thriller novel he does not recall writing. The events described in these pages begin to manifest in reality, and Alan encounters hostile supernatural entities known as the ""Taken,"" who are controlled by darkness. The gameplay involves navigating Bright Falls and using light to combat these dark forces. The storyline explores themes of reality and fiction, along with the influence of the written word. A string of ritualistic murders threatens Bright Falls, a small-town community surrounded by Pacific Northwest wilderness. Saga Anderson, an accomplished FBI agent with a reputation for solving impossible cases arrives to investigate the murders. Anderson’s case spirals into a nightmare when she discovers pages of a horror story that starts to come true around her.

Alan Wake, a lost writer trapped in a nightmare beyond our world, writes a dark story in an attempt to shape the reality around him and escape his prison. With a dark horror hunting him, Wake is trying to retain his sanity and beat the devil at his own game.

Anderson and Wake are two heroes on two desperate journeys in two separate realities, connected at heart in ways neither of them can understand: reflecting each other, echoing each other, and affecting the worlds around them.
Fueled by the horror story, supernatural darkness invades Bright Falls, corrupting the locals and threatening the loved ones of both Anderson and Wake.

It is the result of a collaboration between Square and The Walt Disney Company. The game combines characters and settings from Disney's animated features with those from the Final Fantasy series, developed by Square.

Kingdom Hearts was a departure from Square's standard role-playing games by introducing a substantial action-adventure element. In addition, it has an all-star voice cast which included many of the Disney characters' official voice actors. Kingdom Hearts was longtime Square character designer Tetsuya Nomura's first time in a directorial position.

The game uses an experience based progression system, with experience gained by defeating foes. Experience gained rises in relation to the strength of the foe, and is consistent for each enemy over the course of the game. Levels are gained with experience, and provide increases to stat attributes in strength, defence, magic, hit points, magic points and ability points, with a new, predetermined ability unlocked approximately every four levels. Sora, Donald, Goofy, and Jiminy Cricket are traveling across the universe in the Gummi Ship when they decide to go to sleep. They put the Gummi Ship on autopilot, and in their sleep, a strange creature creeps undetected into the vessel and subsumes Sora's dreams. When he wakes up, he is shipwrecked on a deserted island called Swordman Island, and Donald and Goofy are nowhere to be found. His goal is to find his friends and leave the island, but even after searching every nook and cranny of the island, Sora cannot find Donald and Goofy, so he builds a raft and leaves the island to find them.

The story of Kingdom Hearts V CAST, aside from familiar characters, settings, etc., has nothing to do with the original plot of Kingdom Hearts, and is almost completely irrelevant to the series because its plot is not canon. Kingdom Hearts V CAST also appears to have no plot of its own other than finding Donald and Goofy and it was never directly stated when the events in Kingdom Hearts V CAST happened during Kingdom Hearts because it was not considered a side game of importance, but there are many theories.

The first is that it could have taken place in or during Kingdom Hearts because Sora has already met Donald, Goofy, and Jiminy Cricket and they are traveling in the Gummi ship. It could have happened when they were traveling between different worlds, namely Hollow Bastion and the worlds before it because of the periodic cutscenes showing Maleficent watching Sora through a magical cauldron with green, misty water. These cutscenes suggest that Maleficent is attempting to stall Sora in a dream-like state as he is reaching her lair.",predetermine ability unlock level longtime square character designer tetsuya nomura periodic cutscenes maleficent watch sora kingdom heart cast deserted island swordman island kingdom heart cast happen strange creature creep undetected kingdom heart cast experience base progression,kingdom heart action roleplay game develop publish squaresoft playstation result collaboration square walt disney company game combine character setting disney animate feature final fantasy series develop square kingdom heart departure square standard roleplay game introduce substantial actionadventure element addition allstar voice cast include disney character official voice actor kingdom heart longtime square character designer tetsuya nomura time directorial position game experience base progression experience gain defeat foe experience gain rise relation strength foe consistent enemy game level gain experience provide increase stat attribute strength defence magic hit magic ability predetermined ability unlock level sora donald goofy jiminy cricket travel universe gummi ship decide sleep gummi ship autopilot sleep strange creature creep undetected vessel subsumes sora dream wake shipwreck desert island swordman island donald goofy goal friend leave island search nook cranny island sora donald goofy build raft leave island story kingdom heart cast familiar character setting original plot kingdom heart completely irrelevant series plot canon kingdom heart cast plot donald goofy event kingdom heart cast happen kingdom heart game theory kingdom heart sora meet donald goofy jiminy cricket travel gummi ship happen travel hollow bastion periodic cutscenes maleficent watching sora magical cauldron green misty water cutscenes maleficent attempt stall sora dreamlike reach lair

Your job as immigration inspector is to control the flow of people entering the Arstotzkan side of Grestin from Kolechia. Among the throngs of immigrants and visitors looking for work are hidden smugglers, spies, and terrorists. Using only the documents provided by travelers and the Ministry of Admission's primitive inspect, search, and fingerprint systems you must decide who can enter Arstotzka and who will be turned away or arrested. The gameplay of Papers, Please focuses on the work life of an immigration inspector at a border checkpoint for the fictitious Eastern Bloc country of Arstotzka. The player inspects would-be immigrants' documents and uses a sparse array of tools to determine whether the papers are in order for the purpose of keeping spies, smugglers and other unwanted individuals out of the country. At the end of each in-game day, the player earns money based on how many immigrants they processed less any penalties for mistakes, and then must decide on a simple budget to spend that money on rent, food, heat, and other necessities in low-class housing for themselves and their family. As relations between Arstotzka and nearby countries deteriorate due to multiple terrorist attacks, each day introduces a new set of rules for immigration based on the game's story, such as denying citizens of specific countries or demanding more exacting identification from citizens. The player may be challenged with moral dilemmas and social engineering as the game progresses; such as allowing the supposed spouse of one immigrant through despite them lacking complete papers, even though they may be planning to attack your fellow guards.
A mysterious anti-government organisation also appears, with several of its members appearing in the checkpoint, giving the inspector orders on what to do in order to help the organisation bring down the government and establish a new one; the player can choose whether or not to help this organisation.
The game has a scripted story mode with multiple possible endings depending on the player's previous actions, as well as an unlockable, randomized endless-play mode.

In each trial, you'll have to use the evidence and testimony collected during your investigation to literally shoot down your opponent's assertions. By combining logic and motion, ""Danganronpa"" offers an exciting and unprecedented gaming experience. Hope's Peak Academy is a government-funded private high school recognized all across the nation as the cradle of hope and prosperity, providing a complete education for ""ultimate"" students of all stripes.

Thanks to a national lottery, one extremely lucky but otherwise ordinary student—Makoto Naegi—has been chosen to attend this prestigious institution.

But when Makoto arrives for his first day of class, he suddenly falls unconscious, and when he wakes up he finds himself in a classroom within the school—with the windows barred and the doors locked. As he explores the abandoned, dirty halls, it becomes clear that something is very wrong. He and his new classmates make their way to the gymnasium, where a demented robotic bear, calling himself Monokuma and claiming to be the school's headmaster, makes a declaration: ""You're all going to be living here from now on. If you want to go free, your only choice...is murder.""

And so...fifteen high school students gathered from across the country have been imprisoned. Their strength, their commitment, their very humanity will be tested time and time again.

It featured revolutionary pre-rendered 3D graphics that give the game a very unique look compared to most other games on consoles at the time. The two playable characters featured in the game are the titular character, Donkey Kong and his nephew, Diddy Kong. Together the two swing, climb, jump, swim, cartwheel, ride animals, and blast out of barrels on their way to recover their stolen bannanas from the evil King K. Rool and his Kremling army. The adventure takes you through a variety of different environments and levels that continually change up gameplay. Donkey Kong Country also provides plenty of opportunities for exploration with almost every level having a multitude of collectible, shortcuts, and hidden bonus areas. On a dark and stormy night in Donkey Kong Island, Diddy Kong, Donkey Kong's nephew has taken the weighty responsibility of guarding DK's precious banana hoard for one night, as a part of his ""hero training"". DK entrusts Diddy with protecting the hoard until midnight, when he would be relieved, while DK himself goes to sleep as he is tired.

Everything seems to go smoothly in the hoard until Diddy hears some noises. Diddy hears some voices outside and gets scared, asking who's there. King K. Rool, who had commanded his Kremling minions to steal the bananas. Two ropes drop from above and suddenly two Kritters appear. Diddy cartwheels them both easily, but then a Krusha (Klump in the instruction booklet) comes in as backup. As Diddy is not strong enough to defeat Krusha by himself, he is overpowered and defeated by the Kremling. The lizars seal Diddy inside a barrel and then throw it in the bushes.
Donkey's grandfather, Cranky Kong, rushes inside the treehouse to tell Donkey Kong to wake up so he may tell him what happened. He then tells Donkey to check his Banana Cave. Donkey Kong is infuriated, exclaiming that the Kremlings will pay for stealing his banana hoard and kidnapping his little buddy.

Much of the gameplay takes place on foot, but also includes segments focused on vehicular combat. The balance of weapons and objects in the game was adjusted to better adhere to the ""Golden Triangle of Halo"": these are weapons, grenades, and melee attacks, which are available to a player in most situations. Players may dual-wield some weapons, forgoing the use of grenades and melee attacks in favor of the combined firepower of two weapons. Many weapons available in previous installments of the series return with minor cosmetic and power alterations. Unlike previous installments, the player's secondary weapon is visible on their player model, holstered or slung across the player's back.
Halo 3 introduces ""support weapons"", which are cumbersome two-handed weapons that slow the player, but offer greatly increased firepower in return. In addition to weapons, the game contains a new class of gear called equipment; these items have various effects, ranging from defensive screens to shield regeneration and flares. Only one piece of equipment can be carried at a time. The game's vehicular component has been expanded with new drivable and AI-only vehicles.

The game gives players up to fourteen playable characters, the largest cast in the series, and features the Active Time Battle pseudo-turn based menu command system. A party can consist of up to four characters, though some events require the player to assemble three different parties of up to four and switch between them.

Each character has a unique command ability, such as Terra's Trance, Locke's Steal, Edgar's Tools or Sabin's Blitz, and can also learn Magic spells from earning AP from battles with magicite equipped. Each character's rare Desperation Attack will randomly activate after using the Attack command when at critical health. In the town of Narshe, Terra participates in an Imperial mission to seize a powerful Esper encased in ice. Upon locating it, a magical reaction occurs between Terra and the Esper; as a result, the soldiers accompanying Terra are killed and Terra is knocked unconscious. Upon awakening, Terra is informed that the Empire had been using a device called a ""slave crown"" to control her actions. With the crown now removed, Terra cannot remember anything more than her name and her rare ability to use magic unaided. Terra is then introduced to an organization known as the ""Returners"", who she agrees to help in their revolution against the Empire. The Returners learn that Imperial soldiers, led by Kefka, are planning another attempt to seize the frozen Esper. After repelling Kefka's attack, Terra experiences another magical reaction with the frozen Esper; she transforms into a creature resembling an Esper and flies to another continent. Upon locating Terra, the party is confronted by an Esper named Ramuh, who informs the group that Terra may require the assistance of another Esper imprisoned in the Imperial capital city of Vector.",base menu command terra experience magical reaction assemble party active time battle pseudo learn magic spell terra remember,final fantasy sixth main installment final fantasy series develop publish square final title series feature twodimensional graphic story revolve crystal game player fourteen playable character cast series feature active time battle pseudoturn base menu command party consist character event require player assemble party switch character unique command ability terra trance locke steal edgar tool sabin blitz learn magic spell earn ap battle magicite equip character rare desperation attack randomly activate attack command critical health town narshe terra participates imperial mission seize powerful esper encase ice locate magical reaction occur terra esper result soldier accompany terra kill terra knock unconscious awaken terra inform empire device slave crown control action crown remove terra remember rare ability magic unaided terra introduce organization returners agree revolution empire returners learn imperial soldier lead kefka plan attempt seize frozen esper repel kefka attack terra experience magical reaction frozen esper transform creature resemble esper fly continent locate terra party confront esper ramuh inform terra require assistance esper imprison imperial capital city vector

In this conflict, the mechanized creations of men reign supreme, facing off against each other as their creators stay safe and unconflicted, and in the process grow ever softer. In this scenario an important question will be asked: What happens when an enemy steals the keys to your war? To understand such a possible future, you must understand where you have been. In Cold War-era Nevada, a team of CDC operatives investigate a nuclear testing site known as ""Nuketown"", where they are attacked by zombies. Dr. Edward Richtofen is heard via a television, carrying out his scheme on the Moon. Richtofen seizes control of the zombies by entering the Aether, but Dr. Ludvig Maxis works with his daughter Samantha and Richtofen's former allies, Tank Dempsey, Nikolai Belinski, and Takeo Masakai to thwart him. To this end, Maxis launches three massive nuclear missiles filled with Element 115, the element responsible for the reanimation of dead cells, at the Earth, destroying it. One missile completely destroys Nuketown and all present.
Years later, Earth has been reduced to a crumbling, hellish wasteland overrun by zombies. In this new world, four survivors - Samuel J. Stuhlinger, Abigail ""Misty"" Briarton, Marlton Johnson, and Russman - have banded together to survive in Washington with the help of a bus driven by a robotic driver. The four are contacted by Maxis, now an digitally-rendered A.I., who is seeking humanity's aid against Richtofen. Maxis implores them to power up a tower in a cornfield using an electricity-based zombie. However, Richtofen contacts Samuel, who is able to hear voices from the Aether, and commands him to convince his friends to power up the tower in his favor. The player may choose to follow either Maxis or Richtofen's orders. It is revealed in audio transmissions that survivors from all over the world have been contacted by both Maxis and Richtofen, though there is widespread conflict between the followers of both Germans; particularly in a settlement known as Jackass Flats, which was initially a safe haven, only to fall to the zombies when the Maxis-Richtofen conflict consumed it.
Regardless of who they choose to aid, the four are teleported to a crumbling skyline in Shanghai, China. Here, Richtofen commands Samuel to ""mend the rift"" and accept his fate as a follower of Richtofen, threatening to expose his past as a member of a cannibalistic cult known as The Flesh, who eat zombie flesh to survive. Richtofen continuously revives the group whenever they fall to the zombies until they follow his orders. Maxis, who is no longer hampered by electric devices, contacts the group again for aid. The four learn through televisions scattered across the area of the Flesh, as well as the beginnings of a new airborne plague of Element 115, the element that reanimates dead cells and causes zombies.
Following their battles in Shanghai, Russman leads the group across the continents to a large hole in the ground known as ""the Rift"" in Africa, hoping to find answers about the unseen forces commanding them. Maxis and Richtofen contact them once again, more desperate than ever to achieve their goals. Both of them ask the group to power up the third and final tower in their favor. Maxis promises to heal the Earth, and Richtofen promises to save them from Maxis. The four gain a new ally in the form of a mute, unnamed giant in a western town built underground, and are hampered by a ghostly woman in a massive mansion. Depending on who the player has aided in the story, there are two possible endings. If the player has aided Richtofen, he will gain unlimited power over the Aether and the Earth, kill Maxis and condemn Samantha Maxis' soul to eternal damnation. He will then enter the body of Samuel as a reward for his aid, but finds he cannot exit it, and is at the mercy of the zombies as he was before. If the player has aided Maxis, he uses the power from the towers to enter the Aether and assume ultimate control, trapping Richtofen in a zombie's body. However, the Earth begins shaking, and Maxis explains to the four that he is beginning the process of the destruction of the Earth and humanity to reach Agartha, where he believes Samantha is.
Unbeknownst to all, Samantha is indeed in Agartha (which her father ultimately fails to enter) but reaches out to her father in 1918 France during World War I. Maxis is a leader of Group 935, who operate to secure Germany's victory in the war. To this end, they have created towering mechanical robots, suits of armor, and staffs that control the powers of the elements. Group 935 also stumbles upon an ancient tomb believed to be of Vrill origin, but this unleashes the first known zombie outbreak in history. Aiming to stop Germany, Japan, Russia and the United States of America send Takeo, Nikolai and Dempsey to capture Richtofen, the mastermind behind the advanced technology. By this time, Group 935's operatives have been wiped out, and Maxis himself was lobotomized when he began to turn into a zombie. The group put aside their nationalities to fight the undead, and are contacted by Samantha, begging to be freed from Agartha. Richtofen puts Maxis' brain in a flying drone, and he joins the fight against the zombies and to free Samantha. The group is eventually successful, and while Maxis meets his daughter, they enter Agartha to be rewarded. A cutscene is played of Samantha with a boy named Eddie, playing with toys of the characters who have appeared in the Zombies game mode throughout all three games. Air raid sirens are heard and the two children retreat to the basement with Maxis, with Samantha noting her father has a plan to make their games real. It is ambiguous as to whether the events of the game mode have actually occurred or has all along been simply in Samantha's imagination.",maxi launch massive nuclear missile black ops propels player missile completely destroy nuketown stumble nuclear western town build underground create tower mechanical robot zombie outbreak process grow soft century cold war,push boundary fan expect recordsetting entertainment franchise duty black ops propels player future century cold war technology weapon converge create generation warfare foe conflict mechanized creation reign supreme creator stay safe unconflicted process grow softer scenario question happen enemy steal key war understand future understand cold warera nevada team cdc operative investigate nuclear testing nuketown attack zombie dr edward richtofen hear television carry scheme moon richtofen seize control zombie enter aether dr ludvig maxi daughter samantha richtofen ally tank dempsey nikolai belinski takeo masakai thwart maxi launch massive nuclear missile element element responsible reanimation dead cell earth destroy missile completely destroy nuketown earth reduce crumble hellish wasteland overrun zombie survivor samuel stuhlinger abigail misty briarton marlton johnson russman band survive washington bus drive robotic driver contact maxi digitallyrendered seek humanity aid richtofen maxi implore power tower cornfield electricitybased zombie richtofen contact samuel hear voice aether command convince friend power tower favor player choose follow maxi richtofen reveal audio transmission survivor contact maxi richtofen widespread conflict follower german settlement jackass flat initially safe fall zombie maxisrichtofen conflict consume choose aid teleport crumble skyline shanghai china richtofen command samuel mend rift accept fate follower richtofen threaten expose cannibalistic cult flesh eat zombie flesh survive richtofen continuously revive fall zombie follow maxis hamper electric device contact aid learn television scatter flesh airborne plague element element reanimate dead cell zombie follow battle shanghai russman lead continent hole ground rift africa hop answer unseen force command maxi richtofen contact desperate achieve goal power final tower favor maxi promise heal earth richtofen promise save maxis gain ally form mute unnamed giant western town build underground hamper ghostly woman massive mansion depend player aid story player aid richtofen gain unlimited power aether earth kill maxi condemn samantha maxi soul eternal damnation enter body samuel reward aid exit mercy zombie player aid maxi power tower enter aether assume ultimate control trap richtofen zombie body earth shake maxi explains process destruction earth humanity reach agartha samantha unbeknownst samantha agartha father ultimately fail enter reach father france war maxi leader operate secure germany victory war create tower mechanical robot suit armor staff control power element stumble ancient tomb vrill origin unleash zombie outbreak history aim germany japan russia united america send takeo nikolai dempsey capture richtofen mastermind advanced technology time operative wipe maxis lobotomized zombie nationality fight undead contact samantha begging agartha richtofen maxis brain fly drone fight zombie samantha eventually successful maxis meet daughter enter agartha reward cutscene play samantha boy eddie play toy character zombie game mode game air raid siren hear child retreat basement maxi samantha note father plan game real ambiguous event game mode occur simply samantha imagination

The search turns deadly when Nathan Drake becomes stranded on the island and hunted by mercenaries. Outnumbered and outgunned, Drake and his companions must fight to survive as they begin to unravel the terrible secrets hidden on the Island. Treasure hunter Nathan ""Nate"" Drake (Nolan North), accompanied by reporter Elena Fisher (Emily Rose), recovers the coffin of his self-proclaimed ancestor Sir Francis Drake, having located it from coordinates inscribed on a family heirloom: a ring Nate wears around his neck. The coffin contains Sir Francis Drake's diary, which gives the location of El Dorado. Pirates attack and destroy Nate's boat, but Nate's friend and mentor Victor ""Sully"" Sullivan (Richard McGonagle) rescues the two in his seaplane. Fearing Elena's reporting will attract potential rivals, Nate and Sully abandon her at a dock.

Following the diary to the indicated spot, Nate and Sully discover an alcove that once held a large statue, and realize that El Dorado is not a city but rather a golden idol. They find a Nazi U-boat, which contains a page from Drake's diary showing the statue was taken to an island. However, mercenaries led by criminal Gabriel Roman (Simon Templeman) and his lieutenant Atoq Navarro (Robin Atkin Downes) intercept Nate and Sully. Sully is seemingly killed by a shot to the chest, but Nate manages to escape, encounters Elena, and flies with her to the island.

On the way, anti-aircraft fire forces Elena and Nate to bail out and they are separated. After retrieving supplies from the wrecked seaplane, Nate heads toward an old fort to find Elena. Briefly captured by pirates led by old associate Eddy Raja (James Sie), Elena breaks Nate free and they flee to the island's old customs house. After finding records showing the statue was moved further inland, they find that Sully is alive and accompanying Roman and Raja. Nate and Elena find and rescue Sully who, having survived due to Drake's diary blocking the bullet, explains he was buying time for Nate by giving Roman misinformation.",james sie elena break nate proclaim ancestor sir francis drake coffin sir francis drake nolan north accompany emily rise recovers sir francis drake set aircraft force elena nathan drake strand nate wear associate eddy raja,yearold clue coffin sir francis drake set modernday fortune hunter exploration fabled treasure el dorado lead discovery forgotten island middle pacific ocean search deadly nathan drake strand island hunt mercenary outnumber outgunned drake companion fight survive unravel terrible secret hide island treasure hunter nathan nate drake nolan north accompany reporter elena fisher emily rise recovers coffin selfproclaimed ancestor sir francis drake locate coordinate inscribe family heirloom nate wear neck coffin sir francis drake diary location el dorado pirate attack destroy nate boat nate friend mentor victor sully sullivan richard mcgonagle rescue seaplane fear elena report attract potential rival nate sully abandon dock follow diary spot nate sully discover alcove hold statue realize el dorado city golden idol nazi uboat drake diary statue island mercenary lead criminal gabriel roman simon templeman lieutenant atoq navarro robin atkin downes intercept nate sully sully seemingly kill shot chest nate manages escape encounter elena fly island antiaircraft force elena nate bail separate retrieve supply wrecked seaplane nate head fort elena capture pirate lead associate eddy raja james sie elena break nate flee island custom house record statue inland sully alive accompany roman raja nate elena rescue sully survive drake diary block bullet explain time nate roman misinformation

After Samus' exploits in the Super Nintendo classic Super Metroid, the intergalactic bounty hunter becomes infected with a parasitic life form known only as ""X"". Samus is rescued and revived by Metroid DNA only after undergoing some major changes in her body and suit, resulting in a drastic change in her appearance, and a new ability to absorb and assimilate the abilities of the ""X"" virus. Experience a new and enthralling chapter in the Metroid series, and relive the timeless gameplay and exploration that made the series a legend. The game begins with Samus Aran acting as a bodyguard for the Biologic's research team on planet SR388. Eventually, a Hornoad confronts them and is killed by Samus. However, a globular yellow organism (an X) emerges from the Hornoad as it is destroyed and enters Samus's body.
Feeling no initial effects, Samus continues escorting the researchers and completes the assignment. On the way back to the laboratory, however, Samus loses consciousness, and her gunship crashes into an asteroid belt. The ship's emergency systems automatically ejected Samus' escape pod, saving her from the crash, but her gunship is completely destroyed. Samus is quickly attended to by a medical crew, who discover that the creature that entered her body on SR388 was actually a parasitic organism that they soon named X.

Samus Infected 2
Samus, infected by the X Parasites.
The organic components of Samus's Power Suit had become so integrated with her system that it could not be removed while she was unconscious. Large portions of her infected suit had to be surgically removed, dramatically altering its appearance. However, the X in Samus's central nervous system were too embedded to be removed safely; Samus's chances of survival were lower than one percent.
Metroids are the only known predator of the X; however, since Samus destroyed all the Metroids on SR388 in a previous mission, the X were able to multiply unchecked. Seeing this as the key to curing her, doctors proposed using a Metroid cell from Samus' dead Baby Metroid to make an anti-X vaccine. Apparently, the Federation had managed to preserve a cell culture from the Baby that saved Samus while she was on Zebes a second time. The serum was prepared and injected without delay, completely eradicating the X. There were, however, two side effects: Samus could no longer be hurt by normal X and could even absorb them to replenish health and ammunition, but she also inherited the Metroids' vulnerability to cold.

Upon recovering, Samus is sent to investigate an explosion on the Biologic Space Laboratories research station, where the specimens from SR388 and the infected pieces of her Power Suit are being held. Once she arrives at the station, Samus immediately heads to the Quarantine Bay, where she encounters and kills a Hornoad that has been infected by an X parasite. Samus speaks with her new gunship's computer (whom she has named ""Adam"", as it reminds her of a former CO) and learns that the specimens brought back by the field team have become infected by the X. The computer also reveals that the X can use the DNA of its prey to create a perfect copy, meaning any organic life on the station may also be infected.

SA-X 1
The SA-X.
As she continues to explore the station, Samus discovers that the X have used the infected portions of her Power Suit to create a copy of Samus herself, dubbed the SA-X (or Samus Aran-X). Since the SA-X arose from Samus's fully-upgraded Power Suit, it has all of her powered-up abilities, as evidenced by it using a Power Bomb to escape the Quarantine Bay. By exploding the bomb, the SA-X also destroyed the capsules holding the X specimens, releasing them all into the station. Well into her investigation of the station, Samus stumbles upon the facility's Restricted Lab. Here, she finds dozens of infant Metroids and several more Metroids in various stages of maturity, all in stasis; these were the results of a cloning project of which Samus was not previously aware. Shortly after Samus discovers them, the SA-X attempts to destroy its predators, but its plan backfires: the Metroids break free and the emergency fail-safes are activated as a result. Samus barely escapes before the lab locks down completely and is jettisoned from the station, exploding over SR388.
After the incident at the Restricted Lab, Samus speaks with her ship's computer, who is angry about the discovery and subsequent destruction of the Metroids. The computer explains that the Federation had been secretly working on a Metroid breeding program, for ""peaceful applications"". The computer reveals that the station's SRX environment, a replica of the SR388 ecosystem, was ideal for raising Alpha, Gamma, Zeta, and even Omega Metroids. The research uncovered techniques for rapid growth, allowing an infant grow into an Omega Metroid in mere days. Unfortunately, the SA-X had been tracking Samus down and followed her to the lab's location. Much to Samus's surprise, the computer also mentions that the SA-X has been reproducing asexually and there are no fewer than 10 aboard the station.

Later, the computer tells Samus that she has caused enough damage and instructs her to leave the rest of the investigation to the Federation. Apparently, the Federation has taken an interest in the X and SA-X and believe that this life-form has endless applications. Samus, having seen the SA-X's destructive capabilities firsthand, is strongly against this. She is convinced that the X will overwhelm the Federation troops as soon as they land, absorbing their powers and knowledge in the process. If this happens, they could easily spread throughout the galaxy and ""galactic civilization will end.""

As an alternative, Samus decides to activate the station's self-destruct mechanism in order to destroy the X, risking her own life in the process. However, her ship's computer has locked Samus in a Navigation Room, as the Federation has ordered it to keep her confined until their arrival. Desperate, Samus yells at the computer: ""Don't let them do this. Can't you see what will happen, Adam?"" Puzzled at the use of the name, the computer inquires as to who this Adam was. Samus reveals that he had been her previous commanding officer and had died saving her life. Apparently moved by Samus's revelation, the computer agrees with the plan, and suggests that if Samus were to alter the station's orbit, then she might be able to include the planet in the explosion, thus ensuring the destruction of the X on planet SR388 as well as those on the station. At this point, Samus realizes that her ship's computer truly is Adam Malkovich, whose personality had been uploaded to a computer prior to his death.

Samus hurries to the Operations Room, where she is confronted by an SA-X. She manages to defeat it, but its Core-X escapes before she can absorb it. Ignoring its escape, Samus initiates the self-destruct sequence and hurries back to her ship. However, she finds the docking bay in ruins and her ship gone. Before she can react to the situation, an Omega Metroid appears, apparently having escaped from the Restricted Lab before its destruction and grown to full size in record time. Samus possesses no weapon capable of damaging the Metroid, and a single swipe of its claw reduces her energy reserves to one unit. As the Omega Metroid prepares to finish her off, the SA-X returns, and attacks the Metroid with its Ice Beam, injuring it. However, it was greatly weakened from its fight with Samus and is quickly defeated by the Metroid. This time, the Core-X hovers over Samus, allowing her to absorb it and obtain the ""Unnamed Suit"" as well as the Ice Beam and restoring her genetic condition to its pre-vaccine state. Using her regained abilities, Samus fights and kills the Omega Metroid after a fierce struggle. After the battle, Samus's ship reenters the bay, having been piloted by the computer, Adam, and the same Etecoons and Dachoras she saved on the previous mission to Zebes and later on the Habitation Deck.

As Samus leaves the station, it is shown crashing into SR388, destroying both the station and the planet, ridding the universe of the X forever.

Reflecting on her actions, Samus doubts people will understand why she destroyed the X, nor will they realize the danger that was barely averted. Samus believes she will be held responsible for defying the Federation, but Adam comforts her, telling her: ""Do not worry. One of them will understand. One of them must."" A final reflection, Samus goes on to say: ""we are all bound by our experiences. They are the limits of our consciousness. But in the end, the human soul will ever reach for the truth... This is what Adam taught me.""",super nintendo classic super metroid intergalactic bounty hunter infected emergency automatically eject samus biologic space laboratory station easily spread famed metroid series,famed metroid series return game boy advance metroid fusion samus exploit super nintendo classic super metroid intergalactic bounty hunter infect parasitic life form samus rescue revive metroid dna undergo major change body suit result drastic change appearance ability absorb assimilate ability virus experience enthral chapter metroid series relive timeless gameplay exploration series legend game samus aran bodyguard biologic team planet eventually hornoad confront kill samus globular yellow organism emerges hornoad destroy enters samus body feel initial samus continue escort researcher complete assignment laboratory samus lose consciousness gunship crash asteroid belt ship emergency automatically eject samus escape pod save crash gunship completely destroyed samus attend medical crew discover creature enter body parasitic organism samus infect samus infect parasites organic component samus power suit integrated remove unconscious portion infected suit surgically remove dramatically alter appearance samus central nervous embed remove safely samus chance survival percent metroids predator samus destroyed metroids previous mission multiply unchecked key cure doctor propose metroid cell samus dead baby metroid antix vaccine federation manage preserve cell culture baby save samus zebes time serum prepare inject delay completely eradicate samus hurt normal absorb replenish health ammunition inherit metroids vulnerability cold recover samus send investigate explosion biologic space laboratory station specimen infected piece power suit hold arrive station samus head quarantine bay encounter kill hornoad infect parasite samus speak gunship adam remind learn specimen bring field team infect reveal dna prey create perfect organic life station infect sax sax continue explore station samus discovers infected portion power suit create samus dub sax samus aranx sax samus fullyupgraded power suit poweredup ability evidence power bomb escape quarantine bay explode bomb sax destroy capsule hold specimens release station investigation station samus stumble facility restrict lab dozen infant metroids metroids stage maturity stasis result cloning project samus aware shortly samus discovers sax attempt destroy predator plan backfire metroids break emergency failsafes activate result samus barely escape lab lock completely jettison station explode incident restricted lab samus speak ship angry discovery subsequent destruction metroids explain federation secretly metroid breeding program peaceful application reveal station srx environment replica ecosystem ideal raise alpha gamma zeta omega metroids uncover technique rapid growth infant grow omega metroid mere day sax track samus follow lab location samus surprise mention sax reproduce asexually aboard station samus damage instruct leave rest investigation federation federation sax lifeform endless application samus sax destructive capability firsthand convince overwhelm federation troop land absorb power knowledge process happen easily spread galaxy galactic civilization alternative samus decides activate station selfdestruct mechanism destroy risk life process ship lock samus navigation federation confine arrival desperate samus yell happen adam puzzle inquire adam samus reveals previous commanding officer die save life samus revelation agree plan samus alter station orbit include planet explosion ensure destruction planet station samus realize ship adam malkovich personality upload prior death samus hurry operation confront sax manage defeat corex escape absorb ignore escape samus initiate selfdestruct sequence hurry ship dock bay ruin ship react situation omega metroid escape restrict lab destruction grown size record time samus possess weapon capable damage metroid single swipe claw reduce energy reserve unit omega metroid prepares finish sax return attack metroid ice beam injure greatly weaken fight samus defeat metroid time corex hovers samus absorb unnamed suit ice beam restore genetic condition prevaccine regained ability samus fight kill omega metroid fierce struggle battle samus ship reenters bay pilot adam etecoons dachoras save previous mission zebes habitation deck samus leave station crash destroy station planet rid universe reflect action samus doubts people understand destroy realize danger barely avert samus hold responsible defy federation adam comfort worry understand final reflection samus bind experience limit consciousness human soul reach truth adam teach

The robots' behavior has become somewhat unpredictable at night however, and it was much cheaper to hire you as a security guard than to find a repairman.

From your small office you must watch the security cameras carefully. You have a very limited amount of electricity that you're allowed to use per night (corporate budget cuts, you know). That means when you run out of power for the night- no more security doors and no more lights! If something isn't right- namely if Freddybear or his friends aren't in their proper places, you must find them on the monitors and protect yourself if needed!

Can you survive five nights at Freddy's? Freddy Fazbear's Pizza was once a popular restaurant for adults and children alike. However, due to a number of incidents including the kidnapping and implied murder of five children by a man wearing an empty animatronic suit, sanctions by the Health Department over the numerous reports of dirtiness, and ""The Bite of '87"", the pizzeria has fallen on hard times.

The principles and philosophies of Friedrich Nietzsche, Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung influence the plot, character design, and world of Xenogears. Additionally, the symbols, theological concepts, and devotional practices of several world religions are represented in fictionalized forms in the game. Major psychological themes are the nature of identity and human memory, particularly as these relate to the phenomenon of dissociative identity disorder. The relationship between humanity and machines is central to the game's plot, as indicated by the presence of giant robots dubbed ""gears,"" which almost each playable character can control. Full Story, spoils everything:

""In the beginning, Deus was created. This has made a lot of people very angry and has been widely regarded as a bad move.

The creation of an unknown spacefaring civilization, Deus was originally intended to serve as a biological weapon. To power Deus, an entity known as the Wave Existance is summoned from another dimension and trapped inside Deus's engine, Zohar. However, its creators deem Deus too powerful to use, and they attempt to dispose of it by shipping it away on a spaceship called the Eldridge.

Deus, being a sentient organism, discovers the plan to eliminate it and attacks the Eldridge in transit. After much gratuitous usage of the word ""evacuate"", the Eldrige crashes on a nearby planet. The sole survivor of the crash is a young boy -- the first incarnation of Fei -- who was left crying for his mother.

Although its physical form was trapped inside Zohar, the Wave Existance is able to instill its power in the boy, who had looked upon it during the attack, in an effort to destroy Deus and free itself. The Wave Existance than creates a woman -- Elly -- in the image of Fei's mother and gave her its will.

In order to defend itself, Deus used part of itself to create the first humans -- Cain, the Gazel, and Miang. Miang possesses the Ouroborous (or Urobulos according to Professor Daravon ^_^) Gene, which is passed on to all the women in the world, as they were all descended from her. This gene allowed any woman to become Miang, thus guaranteeing her immortatilty.

The next time we see Fei and Elly, they are in their second incarnation (the Wave Existance keeps reincarnated them); Fei is called Abel, and Elly is Elly as always. They are running from Cain, who kills Elly.

Fei and Elly's third incarnation occurs in the Zeboim civilization (which I think is supposed to be present-day Earth). Here, people live in flying cities above the ground and fight with giant robots called Gears, which use the energy emitted from Zohar to function. However, genetic flaws have rendered many people, including Elly, unable to have children. Kim (Fei), who seems to be a scientist, creates an articial human with self-healing nanomachines, whom he names Emeralda. Just then, guards burst in and kill Elly, and presumably Kim as well.

When the fourth incarnation rolls around, only one flying city remains from the collapsed Zeboim civilization: Solaris, ruled by Emperor Cain and the Gazel Ministry. Solaris rules the world below, but a band of rebels, including Lacan (Fei's fourth incarnation), Sophia/Elly (her real name seems to be Elly, but she is known as Sophia in Nisan), Krelian, and Roni and Rene Fatima are fighting against them.

The land-dwellers are aided by Shevat, a new flying city being constructed atop the Tower of Babel (which is also part of the Ft. Jasper weapons system) under the supervision of Queen Zephyr. Shevat is also home to three Gurus -- Gaspar, Taura Melchior, and Balthasar. Taura teaches Krelian about nanotechnology.

Shevat, however, decides to reveal the position of the rebels to Solaris in exchange for their own safety. Solaris promptly attacks the rebel camp in Nisan, catching the troops off guard. To defend her people, Sophia/Elly sends her ship on a suicide run at the Gebler forces. Her comrades escape, but Krelian goes postal and runs off saying that if there must be no god and he will create god himself. Lacan also goes berserk, and is transformed by the Wave Existance into two parts -- his body becomes Grahf, while his soul is passed on to the next incarnation.

Soon thereafter, a bunch of mysterious monsters called the Diabolos appear and attack the world. Solaris and the land-dwellers call a temporary truce to their fighting to fight the Diabolos. With the power of the Omnigears, such as Roni's Andvari, the humans win. During the conflict, however, the Gazel are killed, and their personalities are stored in the data banks of Solaris's SOL-9000 computer.

In the aftermath of the war, Solaris sets up the -Ethos-, a faux religion with which they control the earth-dwellers, and begins using its Soylent System to turn the test subjects of its genetic experiments into food products or Wels. A special drug, the Limiter, is placed in the food, which renders those who consume it -- all the land-dwellers -- unable to resist Solaris.

As the loser of the war, Shevat goes into hiding by concealing itself behind its Gate. Roni and Rene found Aveh, and Kiselv is also founded by some other guy (we don't know who). Meanwhile, Krelian has joined Solaris to pursue his mission of resurrecting Deus.

Several hundred years later, things have changed little. Solaris has been manipulating a war between Aveh and Kislev on the surface to prevent the earth-dwellers from gaining in power. Krelian, who is pulling all the strings in Solaris, attempts to create a Contact for the Wave Existance. He genetically engineers a clone of Cain that features all the best traits of humanity -- Ramsus -- in hopes that he will be able to contact the Wave Existance. He soon discovers that Ramsus is not needed, as the real Contact has been born to Wong Khan and Karen, agents of Shevat.

Miang takes over the body of Wong Karen and begins subjecting Fei to psychological tests to determine if he is really the Contact. Time again and time again Fei destroys the Solaris researchers who try to probe his mind.

Grahf, who has gone through several bodies in his quest for destruction, hears of Fei's birth and journeys to the Wongs' home in Lahan in order to claim the body of the new incarnation of Lacan. He uses his powers to draw out Fei's inner power, and he (Fei) unleashes a blast of energy that kills Karen. Grahf then spirits the 'awakened' Fei away and makes him his right-hand man.

Meanwhile, in Aveh, the Fatima Dynasty is overthrown by Shakhan, an Ethos bishop who has the backing of Solaris behind him. King Edbart is killed, but his sons Bart and Sigurd, and retainer Maison, escape in the Yggdrasil, the Aveh flagship, and go to live in Nisan. Solaris sends General Vanderkaum to control the Gebler forces.

Sigurd, however, is abducted by Solaris and forced to join Jugend, their military academy. He eventually joins the Elements force, along with Hyuga Ricdeau (Citan), Miang (in yet another new body), and Jessiah Black. Hyuga/Citan and Sigurd are both supporters of Ramsus's rebellion against the Solaris class system.

Ramsus is called into action when Grahf and Id attack Elru on the surface. Id single-handedly trashes Ramsus's Gear battalion, and the entire country is destroyed. The only survivor is Dominia, who joins with Solaris and later becomes part of the Elements after Jessiah quits to live on the surface with his wife Racquel.

Wong Khan catches up with Id and Grahf and somehow seals the Id part of Fei's personality inside and constructs a new persona over it. This persona, the Coward, refuses to acknowledge what he has done, however, and creates a third persona -- the ""normal"" Fei -- to deal with his problems while the Coward relives the memories of his childhood. Meanwhile, Grahf takes over Khan's body, but his control is incomplete -- during lapses of Grahf's control, Khan returns to his normal self, and, during one of these periods, he brings Fei to Lahan Village and leaves him there in the care of Chief Lee.

Sigurd regains his memories of his life on the surface and escapes Solaris to return to aid Bart. He, Maison, and Hans the penguin use the Yggdrasil to prey on Aveh and Kislev troops, thereby keeping either side from becoming too strong and keeping the balance of power.

Also defecting from Solaris is Nikolai Balthasar, son of Shevat's Balthazar. He attempts to flee to Shevat after finding out what Krelian had planned for his Gear research (Deus's revival), but is killed in the attempt and has his mind implanted into the Achtzehn Gear. His daughter Maria manages to escape in the Achtzehn's sister Gear, Siebzehn.

Citan remains behind in Solaris, but is later send to the surface by Cain on a mission to spy on Fei and determine whether he poses a danger.

While not in Khan mode, Grahf is scheming to get Fei back under his control. He has the Kaiser of Kislev manufacture a Gear to his specifications, then arranges for a Gebler force from Aveh to steal it and land in Lahan. A battle ensues, during which Fei hops on board the Weltall, as planned, and uses Id's power to destroy Lahan.

Forced out of the village by the survivors, Fei journeys south through the Blackmoon Forest, where he meets the fifth incarnation of Elly, a Gebler officer and the leader of the group that attacked Lahan. After Fei ""saves"" her from some really wimpy monsters that she could have beaten on her own, she travels with Fei for a short while. That evening, Citan shows up and recommends that Elly leave and return to her family in Solaris. She reluctantly agree.

Citan and Fei are hunting for parts for the damaged Weltall when they are captured by an Aveh transport that was seeking the Weltall. The transport is in turn attacked by the Yggdrasil, and Fei and Citan are brought aboard. They agree to help Bart in his mission to rescue Margie, who has been captured by Shakhan.

The trio frees Margie (and Chu-Chu ^_^) from Fatima Castle and escapes back to Nisan to plan their next move. Meanwhile, Ramsus is appointed head of the Gebler forces, and Vanderkaum is demoted to border patrol.

To overthrow Shakhan, Bart and Citan sneak into the castle, while Fei causes a distraction at the Kislev border. Shakhan sees through their plan and surrounds Bart's team, and they are saved only when Maison rescues them in Citan's Land Crab. Fei meets with more success, as he destroys the Gebler flagship Kefeinzel and Vanderkaum's Gear, the Dora. Grahf then shows up and gives Vanderkaum ""the power"", forcing Fei to transform into Id. Id then annihilates Vanderkaum, Bart's troops, and the Yggdrasil, and severely damages Ramsus's Gear. Citan evacuates the Yggdrasil as it goes down and heads to Nortune to find Fei.

Fei is picked up by some Kislev soldiers and, at Miang's request, is transferred to the prison block of Nortune, the capital of Kislev. Grahf also has the Battling committee actively recruit Fei, and then arranges for the Weltall to be given to him when he enters. Little does Fei know that the Weltall has been rigged to overheat during the match, thus putting Fei out of comission. While unconscious, he changes into Id and kills Rico's men, believing them to be responsible.

After Fei wakes up, he is confronted by Rico, who informs that he is being held responsible for the death of the sewer guards. Rico, Fei, and Citan go to the sewers to investigate and fight and kill a monster called Redrum (actually one of the Wels), thus ""solving"" the mystery. Rico's arm is wounded during the battle with Redrum, however, thus allowing Fei to defeat him in the Battling tournament and become the new Battling champion.

Meanwhile, the Ethos is plotting to eliminate Kaiser Sigmund, as he has been acting too independtly from Solaris. They rig Rico's Gear to go berserk and attack the Kaiser's box, but the Kaiser narrowly escapes death. For this incident, Rico is sentenced to be executed, but he ends up being rescued by Fei, Citan, and Hammer.

Growing desperate, the Gazel order the entire city bombed into oblivion. The Elements and Elly's Gebler squadron are assigned to carry out the mission, but Elly defects to Fei's side and aids him and Rico in directing the Hecht off course. Grahf shows up at the last minute to save Elly.

Back in Aveh, Bart and co. miraculously survive the sinking of the Yggdrasil when they end up in an underground cave containing another Yggdrasil, dating back to Roni's era. This one is designed for sea travel, so Bart's band hits the seas and shoots down Kislev's new Goliath airship on its way to Aveh... only to discover that it was actually Fei and his friends, trying to escape from Kislev in the stolen plane.

Fei and Elly are rescued by the Thames, a floating town commanded by the ""Man of the Sea"". The Thames is currently working for the -Ethos-, which is trying to excavate some Zeboim ruins in order to acquire technology that would allow them to break away from Solaris.

Bart shows up in the Yggdrasil and apologizes for shooting down the Goliath. After a number of failed attacks by Solaris, Ramsus eventually manages to succeed in injuring Fei in combat. Seeing that Fei's wounds require medical attention, the party seeks the help of the healers at the Ethos. While still on the Thames, they meet Billy Lee Black, a priest/exorcist from the -Ethos-, when they save his sister Primera. Billy agrees to help Fei, so they take him to the -Ethos- Headquarters, elsewhere in Aquvy, and have him treated by the doctors there. He is promptly released and taken back to the Yggdrasil sick bay.

In gratitude for Billy's help, the party agrees to accompany him on a mission to destroy a Solaris ship infested with Wels mutants. The mission is a success, but when Billy returns to the Ethos HQ, he finds everyone dead. The attack is the work of his mentor Bishop Stone, who killed all those who were attempting to break away from Solaris. Stone escapes in his Alkanshel (I think that's supposed to be ""Archangel"") Gear to attack the Thames.

During the battle, the Alkanshel is joined by a black ""fishbowl"" device (I believe it's the Soylent System) that drops out Wels. The Thames manages to fend off the attack, but not without being damaged. Citan and the gang follow the ""fishbowl"" to a supposedly-abandoned Solaris dig site, where they discover Emeralda, still left in the tube that she had been created in 4000 years ago. But before they can free her, Stone arrives and captures her, so that Krelian can use her in his nanotechnology experiments. While the party is pursuing Stone out of the dig site, Fei suddenly shows up in Id form and demands that Stone release his daughter. Stone escapes, and suddenly Khan/Wiseman shows up to hold off Id while the party escapes.

Back on the Yggdrasil, Fei turns up at the Gear Dock at loss as to what happened to him. Then Stone, now merged with his Gear, attacks, but Billy and Jessie team up to put him out of commission. The party then goes to Shevat to ally with Solaris's rival. There they meet Maria and Queen Zephyr. Meanwhile, Dominia sneaks into the city and shuts off the shield generators, allowing Solaris to attack.

Fei and friends fend off the initial assault, but then the Achtzehn arrives and uses its Psycho Jammer to freeze the Gears. Enter Chu-Chu, who uses her ""Churansformation"" to assume the size of a Gear and fend off the Achtzehn. Nikolai then transfers his consciousness from Achtzehn to Siebzehn, and has Maria destroy Achtzehn.

Back on the surface, Shakhan's forces invade Nisan. Bart rushes to Nisan and enters the underground Ft. Jasper, where he discovers Roni's Andvari Omnigear. As Ft. Jasper is raised from the ground, Shakhan attacks it, but is forced to retreat. Bart chases Shakhan to a cave and finishes him off, also destroying one of Solaris's Gate generators in the process. Meanwhile, Bart's soldiers retake the capital, and Bart assumes the throne.

To destroy the second Gate, Billy fires a beam from the recently-excavated Ft. Jasper. It bounces off the lens on Babel Tower, designed for just that purpose, and demolishes the Gate under the -Ethos- HQ. The last Gate lies underwater at Sargasso Point, so Fei and co. dive down to destroy it. Along the way, they encounter Emeralda, who is under Krelian's control. After destroying the Gate, they convince Emeralda to come back with them to the Yggdrasil.

With all three Gates destroyed, Solaris appears in the sky. Fei and Elly sneak into the capital district, and after being chased by some Security Cubes, make their way to Elly's house. They attempt to use Elly's father's computer, but are caught by Erich. To Fei's surprise, Erich lets him go and tells him to follow his own path.

Elly stays behind at her house, but soon some Solaris soldiers arrive and demand that her parents turn over Elly for her traitorous acts. Erich stalls the soldiers while Elly escapes. She catches Fei and Citan on their way into the palace via a dust chute.

In the palace, Elly confronts Citan with the accumulated evidence that he is working for Solaris. Before Citan can reply, the lights go out. In the dark, Fei stumbles into the SOL-9000, and is captured. Meanwhile, Citan frees Elly and the rest of the party, who was captured earlier, and removes their Limiters. Hammer is confronted by Krelian, who threatens to mutate him unless he carries out his orders: To capture Elly, whom Krelian needs to resurrect Deus.

Hammer is forced to comply, and while the party is making their escape with Elly's parents, he suddenly points a gun at Elly. Medena forces her way into the path of the gun and advances on Hammer. Hammer panics, shoots her, and runs off. Just then, Grahf and Miang show up and kill Erich in an effort to 'awaken' Elly. They meet with no success, but Fei is 'awakened' and turns into Id. He then destroys Solaris completely, though all of the major villains escape.

Shevat insists on carbon-freezing Fei to prevent him from using his Id power again, but Elly frees him. They fly away in Weltall, but Ramsus arrives. Since he last fought Fei, Ramsus has learned that he was an artificial Contact created and was ""discarded"" once Fei was discovered, and now is obsessed killing him. Using his new Omnigear, he shoots down Weltall.

After their crash landing, Fei and Elly are nursed back to health by Taura Melchior, who lives in seclusion on the surface. Elly, Citan, and Emeralda fire the Limiter cure out of a cannon to spread it across the world, while Fei hurries off to Kislev to stop a last-ditch attack by Solaris. He and Bart combine the Imperial District with the Yggdrasil to form a Gear and destroy Solaris's Fort Hurricane.

Krelian activates the Soylent System and starts mutating people into forms in which they will be able to be assimilated by Deus. While the sisters of Nisan try to cure the mutated people, Fei and company destroy the Soylent System and the Sufal Mass, a huge creature formed of amalgamated mutants.

While Fei and co. search for the remaining Anima Relics that they can use to enhance their Gears, Krelian convinces Ramsus to kill Cain -- as a clone of Cain, Ramsus is the only one who can kill him. Krelian also melds Hammer with a Gear and sends him after Fei, but Hammer is killed.

With Cain out of the way, the Gazel are able to use the Gaetia Key to raise the Eldridge from the sea -- and, in turn, Krelian summarily erases them from the data banks, leaving him in command. Fei shows up in the Eldridge to prevent Krelian from locating Deus's shell, but Grahf takes him captive and tries to crucify him. Elly comes to the rescue in her Omnigear and succeeds in rescuing Fei, but then she is captured by Krelian and Grahf.

Krelian begins construction of Merkava, the ""ark of god"", which he will use to return to the dimension the Wave Existance is from. Fei and Ramsus attempt to stop him; Ramsus kills both Krelian and Miang, but Krelian has already merged with Deus, and Miang merely assumes the body of Elly. Enraged, Fei turns into Id again and is once again carbon-frozen.

While Deus starts assimilating the people of the planet, Id breaks out of his prison and destroys Shevat. Citan and the other characters catch up with him on his way to Contact the Wave Existance. With the aid of Khan, Fei eventually resolves all his multiple personalities, then the Wave Existance appears and changes the Weltall into the Xenogears.

Grahf takes over Khan's body again and tries to kill Fei. Then Deus strikes, however, attempting to destroy Fei before Fei does the same to Deus. Grahf/Lacan/Khan sacrifices himself as a decoy Fei, while Fei and his friends return to Merkava to destroy Deus. They succeed in destroying Zohar, the core, thus freeing the Wave Existance. The energy emitted by the Wave Existance threatens to destroy the world, so Elly (now part of Deus) uses her powers to move Deus out into space.

With the destruction of Zohar, all the Gears have stopped working, except Fei's (which has evolved due to his Contact). Fei blasts out into space after Deus and ends up being sucked into some super-duper dimension, where he must battle the Ouroborous gene itself to return Elly to normal. He succeeds in rescuing Elly, and he and Elly return to the planet as Krelian dies.

During the day, players traverse an expansive urban environment overrun by a vicious outbreak, scavenging the world for supplies and crafting weapons to defend against the growing infected population. At night, the hunter becomes the hunted, as the infected become aggressive and more dangerous. Most frightening are the predators which only appear after sundown. Players must use everything in their power to survive until the morning’s first light. In the city of Harran, a mysterious viral outbreak has turned most of the population into hyper-aggressive zombie-like creatures, forcing Harran's Defense Ministry to quarantine the entire city. The Global Relief Effort (GRE) assists survivors still trapped in the city by regularly airdropping supplies. The GRE hires Kyle Crane to infiltrate Harran in order to retrieve a sensitive file stolen from them by Kadir Suleiman, which he is using as leverage to blackmail them, with the threat of publicizing it if anything were to happen to him. Crane is airdropped into Harran, where he is ambushed by a gang of hostile bandits. As the infected attack, Crane is bitten and infected, but rescued by Jade Aldemir and Amir Ghoreyshi. Amir sacrifices himself to buy Jade and Crane time, and Jade takes him to a survivor sanctuary called the Tower. Crane wakes up and is introduced to Rahim Aldemir, Jade's brother. Rahim then teaches Crane parkour and sends him to Spike, who gives him his first task as a resident of the tower. Crane learns that the Tower, which seeks to help other survivors, is being harassed by a gang of bandits led by a warlord named Rais who steals and hoards the supplies from the GRE airdrops, including Antizin; a vaccine that suppresses symptoms of infection and keeps bitten people from turning into the infected. After Harris Brecken, leader of the tower is nearly killed by a rival runner in a mission to retrieve an Antizin drop, need for the drug becomes immense. Crane volunteers and manages to reach an airdrop containing Antizin, but despite the dire need of the vaccine by the survivors, Crane is instructed by the GRE to destroy the airdrop, instructing him to reach out to Rais in order to buy the vaccine in order to confirm his identity. Crane reluctantly complies and informs the Tower that the supplies have been looted.

Upset, Brecken tasks Crane with the job of making a deal with Rais. Upon meeting Rais, Crane is able to confirm that he is indeed Suleiman. He carries out a series of unethical tasks for Rais under the assumption that he will be rewarded with two crates of Antizin. Crane is unable to locate the file, and is later betrayed by Rais, who only gives him five vials of Antizin. He later breaks off business with the GRE when they halt the supply drops and refuse to help the Tower. The situation in the tower worsens, and a whole floor is sealed off when an outbreak occurs. While doing an errand, Rahim tells Crane that he and Omar were planning to bomb an infected nest. Crane is opposed to this plan. After an argument over the radio, he gives chase to a fleeing Rahim. Upon catching up to him, he finds that Omar is dead, while Rahim has been wounded. He then executes Rahim's plans, resulting in the killing of the infected in the compound. When he gets back to Rahim he discovers that he was actually bitten and had turned while Crane was gone, forcing Crane to respectfully snap Rahim's neck when he attacks him. When Crane returns to the tower to inform Brecken of the news, Jade overhears them, and visibly upset, takes off.

Meanwhile, a scientist at the Tower named Dr. Imran Zere, who was attempting to develop a cure for the virus, is kidnapped by Rais, prompting Crane to attempt a rescue mission. Crane is also captured by Rais, who reveals that the file he stole contains proof that the GRE intends to weaponize the virus rather than develop a cure and releases the file to the public. Crane manages to escape before being executed, resulting in Rais losing one of his hands during the process. Dr. Zere is killed in the rescue attempt, but manages to tell Crane that he had entrusted his research to Jade, who is tasked with delivering it to another scientist named Dr. Allen Camden. As Crane goes to look for Jade, he finds out that the Defense Ministry is planning to bomb Harran in an effort to completely eradicate the outbreak, claiming that there are no survivors left in the city. He manages to reactivate a radio tower and broadcasts a message to the outside world, thwarting the Ministry's plan. Jade was captured by Rais, who also steals Dr. Zere's research. Crane manages to rescue Jade and recover a part of Dr. Zere's research, but Jade admits that she has been bitten, and pleads with Crane to stop Rais. Jade then succumbs to the wound, forcing Crane to kill her. After killing Rais' assistant, Tair with his own machete, Crane delivers the tissue samples to Dr. Camden, who believes that he is very close to the cure, but needs the rest of Dr. Zere's data. Crane then finds out that Rais has cut a deal with the GRE, in which he will hand over Dr. Zere's research data to them in return for extraction from Harran. Crane then assaults Rais' headquarters (filled with infected) and battles him atop a skyscraper, eventually stabbing Rais in the neck and throwing him off the building. He recovers the research data and decides to turn it over to Dr. Camden instead of the GRE, intending to stay in Harran to help the survivors.",action survival horror game set expansive urban environment overrun player assist survivor trap,die light firstperson action survival horror game set vast dangerous day player traverse expansive urban environment overrun vicious outbreak scavenge supply craft weapon defend grow infected population night hunter hunt infected aggressive dangerous frightening predator sundown player power survive morning light city harran mysterious viral outbreak population hyperaggressive zombielike creature force harran defense ministry quarantine entire city global relief effort gre assist survivor trap city regularly airdropping supply gre hire kyle crane infiltrate harran retrieve sensitive file steal kadir suleiman leverage blackmail threat publicize happen crane airdropped harran ambush gang hostile bandit infected attack crane bite infect rescue jade aldemir amir ghoreyshi amir sacrifice jade crane time jade survivor sanctuary tower crane wake introduce rahim aldemir jade brother rahim teach crane parkour send spike task resident tower crane learn tower seek survivor harass gang bandit lead warlord rais steal hoard supply gre airdrops include antizin vaccine suppress symptom infection bitten people infect harris brecken leader tower kill rival runner mission retrieve antizin drop drug immense crane volunteer manages reach airdrop antizin dire vaccine survivor crane instruct gre destroy airdrop instruct reach rais vaccine confirm identity crane reluctantly complies inform tower supply loot upset brecken task crane job deal rais meet rais crane confirm suleiman carry series unethical task rais assumption reward crate antizin crane unable locate file betray rais vial antizin break business gre halt supply drop refuse tower situation tower worsens floor seal outbreak occur errand rahim crane omar plan bomb infected nest crane oppose plan argument radio chase flee rahim catch omar dead rahim wound execute rahim plan result killing infect compound rahim discover bitten crane force crane respectfully snap rahim neck attack crane return tower inform brecken news jade overhear visibly upset scientist tower dr imran zere attempt develop cure virus kidnap rais prompt crane attempt rescue mission crane capture rais reveal file steal proof gre intend weaponize virus develop cure release file public crane manages escape execute result rais lose hand process dr zere kill rescue attempt manage crane entrust jade task deliver scientist dr allen camden crane jade defense ministry plan bomb harran effort completely eradicate outbreak claim survivor leave city manage reactivate radio tower broadcast message thwart ministry plan jade capture rais steal dr zere crane manage rescue jade recover dr zere jade admits bite pleads crane rais jade succumb wound force crane kill kill rais assistant tair machete crane delivers tissue sample dr camden close cure rest dr zere data crane rais cut deal gre hand dr zere data return extraction harran crane assault rais headquarters infected battle atop skyscraper eventually stab rais neck throw building recover data decides dr camden gre intending stay harran survivor

Joined by his partner, ex-yakuza Masaharu Kaito, the crime-fighting duo is called on to investigate a seemingly perfect crime whose lead suspect has an airtight alibi. What starts as a tale of revenge reveals a tangled web of conspiracy involving several unlikely factions taking advantage of a broken law system.

Akihiro Ehara stands accused of groping a woman on a crowded train. A bystander’s video footage of his attempt to flee the scene and subsequent apprehension is all over the news, and public outcry demands a maximum sentence.

“Three days ago, a dead body was found in an abandoned building in Yokohama. Have you identified it yet?” he proclaims as confusion cuts through the court room.

His defense lawyer, Saori Shirosaki, has no doubt that crucial details of the situation have been overlooked, as Ehara was not even tried for the murder. She contacts detective Takayuki Yagami to investigate this further.

How could Ehara have committed two crimes at once? Was the sexual battery just a cover up? Has Ehara gamed the entire justice system? As victims surface and Yagami digs farther into the truth, he is faced with a question: Defend the law, or enact justice?

It was initially released January 2019 for the PlayStation 4 and the Xbox One. An expansion, Kingdom Hearts III Re Mind was released in January 2020.

The story takes place after the events of Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance. It features an older Sora as the main protagonist, who sets forth on a new adventure to search for seven guardians of light in an attempt to stop Xehanort from bringing about a second Keyblade War. Sora is joined by Donald Duck, Goofy, Mickey Mouse, Riku, Kairi, and others. Along the way, Sora travels to many worlds from Disney and Pixar intellectual properties, and cross paths with the real Organization XIII.

Kingdom Hearts III features hack and slash combat reminiscent of Kingdom Hearts II, with elements from later handheld entries, allowing the player to control Sora in a party with Donald, Goofy, and up to two other Disney characters from the various worlds he visits. A major addition compared is the Formchange mechanic, which allows his currently equipped Keyblade to grant him special abilities and change shape. Sora can equip up to three Keyblades at a time, and cycle between them to use his abilities. Another addition is the Attractions mechanic, which occasionally allows Sora to summon and pilot a vehicle inspired by Disney theme park attractions. At certain points throughout the game, the player will be able to control other characters. Through countless adventures across many worlds in his long battle against the darkness, Sora, once a little boy who only dreamed worlds beyond his island even existed, has grown up to a dashing young man. Now he is realizing that that battle has played out exactly as Master Xehanort had planned, and the second Keyblade War, the final struggle between light and dark, looms ahead. To counter the overwhelming darkness, Sora and his friends must gather the seven guardians of light. His best friend Riku and King Mickey seek out a battle-scarred Keyblade wielder, while Sora, Donald, and Goofy set off on a journey to find “the Key to Return Hearts.” Never-before-featured Disney worlds set the stage for another daring adventure to save the universe!

Chosen by the Keyblade, he is the one whose heart’s light never fails to shine as a beacon of hope.

Sora, the brave hero chosen by the Keyblade, has always had a strong sense of justice. Through his many battles against darkness, he has grown and learned about the world immensely.

The game is a legal thriller set in the Yakuza world of Kamurocho and follows private detective Takayuki Yagami as he investigates a serial murder case. It stars Japanese actor Takuya Kimura and employs a fighting system similar to that of Yakuza 0 where players can change into different styles, namely crane-style which is more focused on fighting groups and tiger-style which is more focused on fighting individuals. Additionally, the game features an investigation mode where the player must find traces of the criminal. A lawyer pulls off a miracle, only to have the verdict cost him everything. Now, as a string of murders casts a shroud over the city and the law begins to fail, justice cannot afford to be blind.

The son of a murdered lawyer, Takayuki Yagami was raised on the streets of Kamurocho by a yakuza patriarch who paves the way for Yagami to follow in his real father's footsteps. Taking a job at the Genda Law Office, Yagami accepts a high-profile case: Proving Shinpei Okubo, a man suspected of murder, innocent.

Against all odds, Yagami succeeds and is hailed as a hero, but his prolific career is short-lived. Only months later, Okubo brutally murders his girlfriend, stabbing her over ten times with a kitchen knife before setting their apartment on fire.

Yagami becomes the lawyer who let a murderer walk - and everything he had worked for comes crashing down.

Three years later, Yagami has taken off his lawyer's badge to run a small detective agency in the red-light district of Kamurocho, scraping by on odd jobs and evidence collection.

But even a city as seedy as this is shaken by a string of serial murders, where the victims' bodies are discovered with their eyes gouged out. Yagami is drawn into the case by his old law firm, where he discovers that in order to bring this killer to light, he must seek the truth that slipped from his grasp three years ago. But can a man haunted by his failures prevail over his own past?",star japanese actor takuya kimura follow private detective takayuki yagami player trace grasp,judgment actionadventure game play thirdperson perspective game legal thriller set yakuza kamurocho follow private detective takayuki yagami investigate serial murder star japanese actor takuya kimura employ fighting yakuza player change style cranestyle focused fight tigerstyle focused fight individual additionally game feature investigation mode player trace criminal lawyer pull miracle verdict cost string murder cast shroud city law fail justice afford blind son murder lawyer takayuki yagami raise street kamurocho yakuza patriarch pave yagami follow real father footsteps job genda law office yagami accept highprofile prove shinpei okubo suspect murder innocent odds yagami succeed hail hero prolific career shortlived month okubo brutally murder girlfriend stab time kitchen knife set apartment yagami lawyer murderer walk crash yagami lawyer badge detective agency redlight district kamurocho scraping odd job evidence collection city seedy shake string serial murder victim body discover eye gouge yagami draw law firm discover bring killer light seek truth slip grasp haunt failure prevail

Olympus and the dark depths of Hell to seek revenge on those who have betrayed him. Armed with double-chained blades, and an array of new weapons and magic for this iteration of the trilogy, Kratos must take on mythology's darkest creatures while solving intricate puzzles throughout his merciless quest to destroy Olympus. Utilizing a new game engine built from the ground up and state-of-the-art visual technologies, the development team behind God of War III has made standard-setting strides in giving players the realistic feel of actually being on the battlegrounds. With texture resolutions quadrupling since God of War II on PlayStation 2 computer entertainment system, God of War III, in its debut on the PS3 system, will feature fluid, life-like characters, as well as dynamic lighting effects, a robust weapon system, and world-changing scenarios that will truly bring unmistakable realism to Kratos' fateful quest. Players will have a chance to join battles on a grand scale that is four times larger than its predecessor. Following the ending of God of War II, God of War III picks up directly after this with a stirring opening narration from Zeus discussing the actions of the rogue Kratos, who is 'commanding' a small army of Titans rescued from the Great War (using the power of the Fates). The Olympians immediately rush to battle; Helios rides on his chariot over Olympus, Hermes speeds down the very peaks of Olympus as Zeus watches on, Hercules receives the order to lead his troops down into the fray, Hades lunges off and engages several Titans in his giant form, and Poseidon (using his aquakinesis) shoots down from Olympus like a missile and performs a death blow through the chest of Epimetheus, and then manifests himself as a massive water being and spawns several water horses called Hippocampi to aid in the battle. With Poseidon as their greatest threat in the battle, having already decimated numerous Titans and soon going after Gaia herself, Kratos engages the God of the Sea and after drawing him into Gaia's grasp manages to knock a weakened Poseidon out of his godly form and onto a separate platform. The two quarrel with each other briefly before Kratos walks up and beats the Lord of the Sea savagely, finally gouging out his eyes and snapping his neck before he tosses him into the ocean. With Poseidon's death, the seas cataclysm and ocean levels rise significantly, causing a flood that appears to engulf the entire world and destroying almost all of mankind save those on top of Olympia.",spawn water horse hippocampus playstation entertainment texture resolution quadruple god bring unmistakable realism solve intricate puzzle decimate numerous titan ocean level rise game engine build development team god,set realm brutal greek mythology god war iii singleplayer game player climatic role exspartan warrior kratos scale intimidating height olympus dark depth seek revenge betray arm doublechained blade array weapon magic iteration trilogy kratos mythology dark creature solve intricate puzzle merciless quest destroy olympus utilize game engine build ground stateoftheart visual technology development team god war iii standardsetting stride player realistic feel battleground texture resolution quadruple god war playstation entertainment god war iii debut feature fluid lifelike character dynamic lighting robust weapon worldchanging scenario bring unmistakable realism kratos fateful quest player chance battle grand scale time predecessor follow god war god war iii pick stir narration zeus discuss action rogue kratos command army titan rescue war power fate olympian rush battle helios ride chariot olympus hermes speed peak olympus zeus watch hercules receive lead troop fray hades lunge engage titan giant form poseidon aquakinesis shoot olympus missile perform death blow chest epimetheus manifest massive water spawn water horse hippocampus aid battle poseidon threat battle decimate numerous titan gaia kratos engage god sea draw gaia grasp manages knock weakened poseidon godly form separate platform quarrel kratos walk beat lord sea savagely finally gouge eye snap neck toss ocean poseidon death sea cataclysm ocean level rise flood engulf entire destroy mankind save olympia

Previously, Dubai was a wealthy area with many high profile citizens until catastrophic sandstorms left a majority of the city buried. This caused many to evacuate, leaving only a few behind. One of the people left behind was U.S. Army Colonel John Konrad (a reference to the author of Heart of Darkness, Joseph Conrad), a founding member of Delta Force, who refused to evacuate from a training facility in the city and instead remained behind with the men under his command to help protect the citizens that could not evacuate.

After several weeks of no contact, the Army fears that Col. Konrad and his men are lost to the destruction of the city until a weak distress signal is picked up. This gives the Army reason to deploy the player and their squad, who must infiltrate the city, neutralize outlaws and survive sandstorms as they attempt to determine what happened to Konrad and his men. Through the narrative in the trailer and sound clips from the game's website it is hinted that Konrad may not have entirely genuine motivations for remaining in Dubai against orders.",elite delta force bravo team player character captain martin walker american soldier lead profile citizen army colonel john konrad,thirdperson shooter american soldier lead capt walker send dubai recover remain infantry unit battalion decide action militant situate city progress logistical ethical complexity objective deepens perception enemy question game follow story player character captain martin walker voice nolan north send postapocalyptic dubai elite delta force bravo team dubai wealthy profile citizen catastrophic sandstorm leave majority city bury evacuate leave people leave army colonel john konrad reference author heart darkness joseph conrad founding delta force refuse evacuate training facility city remain command protect citizen evacuate week contact army fear col konrad lose destruction city weak distress signal pick army reason deploy player squad infiltrate city neutralize outlaw survive sandstorm attempt determine happen konrad narrative trailer sound clip game hint konrad genuine motivation remain dubai

Interactive Entertainment, which takes place in the world of J.R.R. Tolkien's Legendarium.

The game takes place in the 60-year gap between the events of Tolkien's The Hobbit and The Lord of The Rings. It is a story of revenge, slaughter, and mystery set entirely in Mordor, the Land of Shadows. At its center is Talion, an ordinary man who loses everything, including his mortal life.

The game is set in a fully open world, and features various role-playing game elements such as experience points and skills. There are various ways the player can complete their main objective. Aside from the main storyline, there are various side quests and random events the player can complete within Mordor.

The melee system is inspired by that of the Batman Arkham series. Getting into a good fighting rhythm, using both regular attacks and counter-attacks will improve the player's combo multiplier.

A unique feature of Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor is the Nemesis system. Every enemy in the game has their own name, rank, and memory. These enemies will continue to do their own jobs and tasks even when they're off screen. If the player does not kill an enemy in an encounter, this enemy will remember the player and change their tactics and conversations based on the encounter. You are Talion, a Ranger of the Black Gate, keeping watch over Mordor which has remained undisturbed for ages. In the blink of an eye, everything is taken from you – your friends, your family, and even your own life.

The player can control six characters from the Sonic universe, each with their own gameplay and point of view of the story. The game is divided up into two types of levels: Action Stages and Adventure Fields. The division of Action Stages and Adventure Fields are a serious departure from all previous Sonic games. Adventure Fields are non-linear game stages that contain very few items, generally designed for puzzle solving, exploration and plot advancement. Action Stages are more speed based and have Rings scattered in them. Sonic Adventure was the top-selling Dreamcast game and received a sequel in 2001, marking the 10th anniversary of the Sonic the Hedgehog series. Doctor Robotnik seeks a new way to defeat his longtime nemesis Sonic and conquer the world. During his research, he learns about an entity called Chaos—a creature that, thousands of years ago, helped to protect the Chao and the all-powerful Master Emerald, which balances the power of the seven Chaos Emeralds. When a tribe of echidnas sought to steal the power of the Emeralds, breaking the harmony they had with the Chao, Chaos retaliated by using the Emeralds' power to transform into a monstrous beast, Perfect Chaos, and wipe them out.

It was originally scheduled to be released on the PlayStation 3 and feature PlayStation Move support, but in August 2014, the game was reintroduced as a PlayStation 4 exclusive.

Until Dawn is designed to be played multiple times, as players will miss out on quite a bit of content with a single playthrough. Each will last about nine hours in length and the game mechanics utilize a new in-game system called the ""Butterfly Effect"" in which any choice of action by the player may cause unforeseen consequences later on. For example, locating a weapon in an earlier chapter may allow the player to pick it up down the line when a chase scene leads back to the same room. Throughout the game, players will make difficult decisions during ethical or moral dilemmas, such as sacrificing one character to save another. The Butterfly Effect system blurs the line between right and wrong decisions and it is possible for players to keep all eight characters alive as well as having all eight of them die, allowing for many different paths and scenarios as well as offering several different endings. Until Dawn has a strict auto-save system to prevent players from reloading a previous save file to an earlier point in the game if they regret an in-game decision they have made. The only way to change the player's choice is to restart the game from the beginning or continue to the end and start a new game. In a developer interview, it has been said that Until Dawn has ""hundreds of endings"". Different endings have different variations depending on the combination of characters alive at the end of the game.

The gameplay is focused on exploration, quick-time events and discovering clues as well as making decisions. There is an in-game system that will keep track of all of the clues and secrets players have discovered in total, even if there are multiple playthroughs; these clues will allow the player to piece together the mysteries of Blackwood. In terms of the gameplay mechanics and theme, Until Dawn has been noted to be similar to Heavy Rain and Beyond: Two Souls.

Until Dawn was met with a positive critical response upon release, with praise directed at the visuals, choice mechanic, horror elements, music, voice acting and gameplay design.

Fallout is set in the timeline which deviated from our own some time after World War II, and where technology, politics and culture followed a different course. In the 21st century, a worldwide conflict is brought on by global petroleum shortage. Several nations begin warring with one another for the last of non-renewable resources, namely oil and uranium; known as the Resource Wars, fighting begins in April 2052 and ends in 2077. China invades Alaska in the winter of 2066, causing the United States to go to war with China and using Canadian resources to supply their war efforts, despite Canadian complaints. Eventually the United States violently annexes Canada in February 2076 and reclaims Alaska nearly a year later. After years of conflict, on October 23, 2077, a global nuclear war occurs. It is not known who strikes first, but in less than a few hours most major cities are destroyed. The effects of the war do not fade for the next hundred years and as a consequence, human society has collapsed leaving only survivor settlements barely able to make out a living in the barren wasteland, while a few live through the occurrence in underground fallout shelters known as Vaults. One of these, Vault 13, is the protagonist's home, where the game begins.

In Vault 13, in 2161 in Southern California, 84 years after the nuclear war. The Water Chip, a computer chip responsible for the water recycling and pumping machinery, breaks. The Vault Overseer tasks the protagonist, the Vault Dweller, with finding a replacement. He or she is given a portable device called the ""Pip-Boy 2000"" that keeps track of map-making, objectives, and bookkeeping. Armed with the Pip-Boy 2000 and meager equipment, including a small sum of bottle caps which are used as currency in the post-apocalyptic world, the main character is sent off on the quest.",united violently annex canada nation war western rpg character build survivor settlement barely underground fallout shelter global nuclear war occurs,vault dweller task explore postnuclear california retrieve water chip replace broken chip vault person leave player engage western rpg character building turnbased tactical combat settlement faction people mutant ghoul branch dialogue tree fallout set timeline deviate time war technology politics culture follow century worldwide conflict bring global petroleum shortage nation war nonrenewable resource oil uranium resource war fight april china invades alaska winter united war china canadian resource supply war effort canadian complaint eventually united violently annex canada february reclaims alaska conflict october global nuclear war occurs strike hour major city destroy war fade consequence human society collapse leave survivor settlement barely living barren wasteland live occurrence underground fallout shelter vault vault protagonist game vault southern california nuclear war water chip chip responsible water recycling pump machinery break vault overseer task protagonist vault dweller replacement portable device pipboy track mapmaking objective bookkeeping arm pipboy meager equipment include sum bottle cap currency postapocalyptic main character send quest

Cranky Kong goes up to him and complains how he never took breaks, ""whisking off maidens and throwing barrels seven days a week"", but Donkey ignores him, confident that he is a hero and that King K. Rool is gone for good. Cranky soon leaves.

Meanwhile, above, Kaptain K. Rool, aboard his vessel, The Flying Krock, commands his minions to invade the island and take Donkey captive so that his next attempt at stealing the banana hoard will not be a failure and the hero will never mess with his plans again. Donkey, still lounging, did not notice the attack until Kutlasses ambushed him and took him prisoner. Kaptain K. Rool assures Donkey Kong that he will never see his precious island or his friends again.

Later and back on the island, Diddy, Dixie and Cranky Kong find Donkey missing, along with a note. It reads:
Hah-arrrrh! We have got the big monkey! If you want him back, you scurvy dogs, you'll have to hand over the banana hoard!

While the games feature several expansions in key areas, the overall plot follows the same direction as the original Gold and Silver. Some aspects exclusive to Crystal are also included. Like how FireRed and LeafGreen could link up with Ruby, Sapphire, and Emerald to complete the Pokédex by trading regionally exclusive Pokémon, HeartGold and SoulSilver can link up with Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum to obtain Pokémon unavailable in Johto and Kanto (such as the Sinnoh starters) and vice versa.
Kris, despite being the female counterpart of Crystal's player character, is not included as the female player character, with a new character instead taking her place.

Step into a locked-down Seattle as Delsin Rowe, who has recently discovered his superhuman power and is now capable of fighting back against the oppressive DUP. Enjoy your power as you choose how you will push your awesome abilities to the limit and witness the consequences of your actions as they affect the city and people around you. Second Son takes place in 2016, seven years after Infamous 2's Conduit protagonist Cole MacGrath sacrifices himself to cure humanity of a plague and destroy The Beast. Cole uses the powerful Ray Field Inhibitor weapon, which kills him and most of the other Conduits. The U.S. government establishes the D.U.P. to hunt down and capture the world's remaining Conduits, dubbing Conduits with the pejorative ""Bioterrorists "". The protagonist is Delsin Rowe (Troy Baker), a 24 year old graffiti artist and the local delinquent of the Akomish reservation. Delsin has the unique Conduit ability of Power Mimicry, allowing him to copy the powers of any Conduit he comes into contact with. His brother, Reggie (Travis Willingham), is the local sheriff, and often arrests Delsin for his acts of vandalism. Both are Akomish Native Americans, whose territory lies at the shore of Salmon Bay, Washington. The antagonist is Brooke Augustine (Christine Dunford), the director of the D.U.P. and a Conduit with power over Concrete. Her actions in the Akomish reservation drive Delsin to travel to Seattle, now under lockdown by D.U.P. forces. Delsin and Reggie encounter three other Conduits: Henry ""Hank"" Daughtry (David Stanbra), a convict with control over Smoke; Abigail ""Fetch"" Walker (Laura Bailey), an ex-junkie who uses her Neon powers to hunt down illegal drug dealers in Seattle; and Eugene Sims (Alex Walsh), a reclusive video game addict who uses his Video (digital materialization) powers to save suspected Conduits from the D.U.P.

after Reggie catches Delsin vandalizing a billboard, their subsequent argument is interrupted when a military truck carrying three Conduit prisoners crashes on the Akomish reservation. Two of the Conduits escape, but Delsin manages to pull the third one, Hank, out of the wreckage, inadvertently absorbing his smoke powers in the process. Shocked and frightened, Delsin pursues Hank in an effort to figure out what has happened and how to control his powers. However, they are both cornered by Brooke Augustine. She encases Hank in concrete and questions Delsin, suspecting him of hiding something. Delsin can choose to either tell Augustine the truth about his powers or say nothing. Regardless of Delsin's choice, Augustine knocks him out before moving on to the other tribe members.

Delsin awakens a week later and discovers that Augustine has tortured the rest of the tribe in an unsuccessful bid to gain information. However, she has left them to gradually die from concrete shards buried into their bodies, including their leader Betty (Karen Austin). Reggie, who was spared from the torture, learns that the only way to remove the shards is to use Augustine's power on them. Delsin realizes that he can absorb Conduit powers and resolves to go to Seattle to take Augustine's powers and save the tribe. Reggie reluctantly accompanies Delsin to keep an eye on him. They reach Seattle and find that it has been put under strict martial law by the D.U.P. in order to find the other escaped Conduits.

This game differs from other Sonic games by allowing the player to take control of one of four teams, each with three characters, who each have unique abilities to use. The game received mixed reviews from critics but it performed commercially well, becoming a million-seller and making the best-selling lists for all three of its original platforms.

As Agent 47, you perform contract hits on powerful, high-profile targets in exotic locations around the world. Gameplay focuses on taking out targets in huge and intricate sandbox levels with complete freedom of approach. Where to go, when to strike and who to kill – it is all up to you.

Hitman is an expanding and evolving world of assassination. The experience began with a Prologue and Paris location in March, continued with Episode 2: Sapienza in April, Episode 3: Marrakesh in May, the Summer Bonus Episode in July, Episode 4: Bangkok in August and Episode 5: Colorado in September. The season finale in Hokkaido, Japan arrived on October 31st.

HITMAN also features a major live component, which is made up of Elusive Targets, Escalation Contracts, Community-inspired Challenge Packs and Contracts Mode.

An Elusive Target is the closest thing to the Hitman fantasy that we’ve ever created. These targets will be custom-created characters that are added to existing locations and are only there for a limited time in real-time. You’ll only have one chance to take them down. If they escape, they are gone for good. If you kill them, that’s the way that you killed them. There are no do-overs and no second chances. When an Elusive Target leaves the game world (one way or another) they never return.

Escalation Mode is something else completely new for HITMAN and was created as a way to regularly provide a fresh challenge to players. You’ll need to master the location as well as the gameplay mechanics to complete a hit that will escalate in difficulty by adding new elements. This mode has a strong focus on having fun with the game mechanics and mixing them up. It’s more about being playful than realistic.

Contracts Mode returns from Hitman Absolution; Play-to-create, mark your own targets, choose how to kill them and compete against your friends. We will also pick the best of the bunch and put them in the Featured Contracts list so you’ve got something fresh to play whenever you load up the game.",completely,master assassin intense spythriller story agent perform contract hit powerful highprofile target exotic location gameplay focus target huge intricate sandbox level complete freedom approach strike kill hitman expand evolve assassination experience prologue paris location march continue episode sapienza april episode marrakesh summer bonus episode july episode bangkok august episode colorado september season finale hokkaido japan arrive october hitman feature major live component elusive target escalation contract communityinspired challenge pack contract mode elusive target close hitman fantasy create target customcreated character add exist location limited time realtime chance escape kill kill doovers chance elusive target leave game return escalation mode completely hitman create regularly provide fresh challenge player master location gameplay mechanic complete hit escalate difficulty add element mode strong focus fun game mechanic mix playful realistic contract mode return hitman absolution playtocreate mark target choose kill compete friend pick bunch featured contract list fresh play load game

Players create their own character by customizing gender and appearance as well as choosing a race and class. Combat is in real time with the ability to pause at any moment: tactical options include an editor which allows the player to give the AI detailed instructions on how to behave in every possible situation. Although the main storyline is the same for every character created, the game features six unique prologues, two for each race. Dragon Age: Origins received critical acclaim upon release, with praise mostly directed at its story, setting, characters, music and combat system. Set in the fictional kingdom of Ferelden during a period of civil strife, the game puts the player in the role of a warrior, mage, or rogue coming from an elven, human, or dwarven background. The player character is recruited into the Grey Wardens, an ancient order that stands against monstrous forces known as Darkspawn, and is tasked with defeating the Archdemon that commands them and ending their invasion.",origin receive critical acclaim release game feature unique prologue,dragon age origins thirdperson roleplay game spiritual successor baldur gate neverwinter night franchise player create character customize gender appearance choose race class combat real time ability pause moment tactical option include editor player detailed instruction behave situation main storyline character create game feature unique prologue race dragon age origins receive critical acclaim release praise direct story set character music combat set fictional kingdom ferelden period civil strife game player role warrior mage rogue elven human dwarven background player character recruit grey wardens ancient stand monstrous force darkspawn task defeat archdemon command invasion

Under the Union's protection are the Hierarchs and the Goddess, currently Caim's sister Furiae, who is a human manifestation of one of the four seals that protect the world from being broken. As the game begins, Cain is fatally wounded in a battle with the Empire. Encountering a captured Red Dragon who is also near death, Caim makes a fateful choice. In exchange for both their lives, the Red Dragon and Caim will enter a pact. This pact will forever chain their lives to one another and link their souls, at the cost of something irreplaceable. Recharged with the fires of a Dragon, Caim's vengeance burns over the enemy...

The player controls Caim on his quest. The game is separated into three distinct modes: Aerial combat, Ground combat and Event Combat. In Aerial Combat, Caim rides dragonback against a variety of airborne foes breathing fireballs (strong single shots and weaker multiple lock-on shots). The Dragon is agile and is able to evade incoming threats, turning around completely in a moment. In Ground combat, the game is shown in 3rd person though usually large, open areas. Controlling Caim, his primary ability is the use of a variety of weapons found on the battlefield, each with their own magic powers. These are leveled up through continued usage, and specifically through the killing of individual enemies. In ground combat, Caim may also call forth his Dragon to ride and strafe enemies from the air. Event combat is similar to Ground combat, but shown isometrically, restricted to a single weapon and without the aid of a dragon. It is used mainly to tell story sequences.",person caim airborne foe breathe fireball kingdomless prince caim,drakengard follow story kingdomless prince caim fight union empire union protection hierarch goddess caim sister furiae human manifestation seal protect break game cain fatally wound battle empire encounter capture red dragon death caim fateful choice exchange life red dragon caim enter pact pact chain life link soul cost irreplaceable recharge dragon caim vengeance burn enemy player control caim quest game separate distinct mode aerial combat ground combat event combat aerial combat caim rid dragonback variety airborne foe breathe fireball strong single shot weak multiple lockon shots dragon agile evade incoming threat completely moment ground combat game person control caim primary ability variety weapon battlefield magic power level continue usage killing individual enemy ground combat caim dragon ride strafe enemy air event combat ground combat isometrically restrict single weapon aid dragon story sequence

After exploring it for a while, he meets a girl who speaks a different language than him, then decides to get both of them out of the castle grounds by leading her along, in order to escape the shadow-like creatures that frequently try to kidnap the girl. In a remote, sunlit forest, several masked men travel on horseback to the edge of an enormous sheer cliff overlooking the sea. Off the coast is an otherworldly, dilapidated fortress, built on tall rocky spires. Some of the men have horns on their helmet. These horns look like those of Malus's head. The men proceed down a winding path towards sea level, get in a small boat, and row silently towards the castle.

They have a prisoner with them: Ico, a boy with an immediately identifiable characteristic: two large horns protruding from his head. These horns are the result of an ancient curse, one that has stricken Ico's village for generations and earned him all its hatred and blame for whatever misfortune comes to its residents. The men have taken him to the castle after his twelfth birthday to place him in a mysterious coffin deep inside the fortress's darkened halls, where he will either starve or succumb to the cold. To open the way to the coffin, they take an enchanted sword that has the ability to open the idol-shaped gates that lead to the room.

The men force him into the coffin, ordering him not to resist and telling him they do this ""for the good of the village"". After they leave, however, a tremor caused by the castle's many aged moving parts dislodges Ico's coffin from the wall, breaking it open but knocking him unconscious. During this time, he experiences a strange vision, set in another part of the castle - a spiked stone cage hangs from the ceiling of an enormous cylindrical room. As Ico approaches the cage on a spiral path that runs up the room's walls, a shadowy substance amasses at the bottom of the cage, overflowing and dripping onto the floor far below. Another shadow emerges from the walls behind Ico, engulfing him and ending the vision. He wakes up.

Ico begins to explore the old castle, pulling levers and opening doors in search of a way out. Soon, however, he finds himself at the bottom of exactly the same room he saw in the vision, including the metal cage hanging from the ceiling. Ico ascends the spiral path until he reaches the top of the room again. This time the cage contains a young girl, Yorda, who sits there quietly. Ico calls out to her and promises to find a way to let her out. He reaches a lever, which lowers the cage close to the ground.

The game takes place in the aftermath of the Calamity, a catastrophic event that suddenly fractured the city of Caelondia as well as the surrounding areas of the game's world into many floating pieces, disrupting its ecology and reducing most of its people to ash. Players take control of the Kid, a silent protagonist who awakens on one of the few remaining pieces of the old world and sets off for the eponymous Bastion, where everyone was supposed to go in troubled times. The only survivor he meets there is an elderly man named Rucks, the game's narrator, who instructs him to collect the Cores that once powered Caelondia. A device in the Bastion can use the power of the crystalline Cores to create landmasses and structures, as well as enable the Kid to travel farther afield via ""skyways"" that propel him through the air.

During his quest, the Kid meets two more survivors: Zulf, an ambassador from the Ura, underground-dwelling people with whom Caelondia was once at war; and Zia, an Ura girl who was raised in Caelondia. Both of them return to the Bastion, but upon reading a journal that the Kid discovers, Zulf intentionally damages parts of the Bastion's central device (the monument) and returns to Ura territory. The Kid learns that the journal belonged to Zia's father, Venn, who had worked for the Caelondians. He had helped Caelondian scientists (""Mancers"") build a weapon intended to destroy the Ura completely to prevent another war. Venn rigged the weapon to backfire, so that when he was finally forced to trigger it, the resulting Calamity destroyed most of Caelondia as well.

To repair Zulf's damage to the Bastion, the Kid starts collecting Shards, a lesser form of Cores. As he obtains the penultimate shard needed, the Ura attack the Bastion, damaging it and abducting Zia. In the next seven days, The Kid engages in sporadic skirmishes in Ura territory. When he finally blasts through an Ura outpost and meets Zia, she tells him that she had left with the Ura voluntarily to find out their intentions; Rucks had previously told Zia that the Bastion had the ability to somehow fix the Calamity. The Kid travels to the once-underground Ura homeland to retrieve the last shard. There, he discovers Zulf being attacked by his own people: the battle with Kid has devastated the Ura forces, and they blame Zulf for bringing the Kid to their home. The Kid can choose to drop his weapon to help Zulf or leave him. If he leaves Zulf behind, the Kid destroys the remnants of the Ura and escapes through a skyway. If he chooses to carry Zulf, Ura archers initially open fire on them but ultimately cease fire and watch silently as the Kid and Zulf take the skyway back to the Bastion.

After the Kid returns and recovers, Rucks gives him another choice: He can have the Bastion rewind time to before the Calamity in the hopes of preventing it, or use it to evacuate the survivors and move on to somewhere safe. Rucks is unsure if there is any way to prevent the Calamity from reoccurring if the time is rewound, as there was no way to test the process. The game ends either way, showing images of the characters (with the inclusion of Zulf if the player chose to rescue him) flying away or of their lives before the Calamity along with the credits. In the New Game+ mode, which is unlocked after beating the game once, it is hinted that restoring the world didn't prevent the Calamity.",caelondian scientist mancers build ura archer initially travel afield zulf intentionally damage elderly ruck kid start collect shard,hackandslash rpg feature reactive narrator unlockable weapon weapon upgrades practice minigames optional difficulty modifier set imaginary aftermath uncertain apocalypse player embody teenager troubled narrator rebuild persisting hub bastion game aftermath calamity catastrophic event suddenly fracture city caelondia surround game float piece disrupt ecology reduce people ash player control kid silent protagonist awaken remain piece set eponymous bastion suppose troubled time survivor meet elderly ruck game narrator instruct collect core power caelondia device bastion power crystalline core create landmass structure enable kid travel afield skyway propel air quest kid meet survivor zulf ambassador ura undergrounddwelling people caelondia war zia ura girl raise caelondia return bastion read journal kid discover zulf intentionally damage bastion central device monument return ura territory kid learn journal belong zia father venn caelondians caelondian scientist mancers build weapon intend destroy ura completely prevent war venn rig weapon backfire finally force trigger result calamity destroy caelondia repair zulf damage bastion kid start collect shard form core penultimate shard ura attack bastion damage abduct zia day kid engage sporadic skirmish ura territory finally blast ura outpost meet zia leave ura voluntarily intention ruck zia bastion ability calamity kid travel onceunderground ura homeland retrieve shard discover zulf attack people battle kid devastate ura force blame zulf bring kid kid choose drop weapon zulf leave leave zulf kid destroy remnant ura escape skyway choose carry zulf ura archer initially ultimately cease watch silently kid zulf skyway bastion kid return recovers ruck choice bastion rewind time calamity hope prevent evacuate survivor safe ruck unsure prevent calamity reoccurring time rewound process game image character inclusion zulf player choose rescue fly life calamity credit game mode unlocked beat game hint restore prevent calamity

It was the final Sonic game for the Dreamcast after Sega discontinued the console. Two new playable characters were introduced, Shadow and Rouge, who would go on to become two of the most recurring characters in the Sonic series. The story features good vs evil: Sonic, Tails and Knuckles attempt to save the world, while Shadow, Doctor Eggman and Rouge attempt to conquer it. The levels are divided into three gameplay styles: fast-paced platforming for Sonic and Shadow, multi-directional shooting for Tails and Eggman, and action-exploration for Knuckles and Rouge. Learning of a secret weapon from the diary of his deceased grandfather, Professor Gerald Robotnik, Eggman infiltrates a high-security G.U.N. facility and revives it using a Chaos Emerald. The weapon – a black hedgehog and self-proclaimed ""Ultimate Life Form"" named Shadow – offers to help Eggman conquer the world, telling him to rendezvous at an abandoned space colony, ARK, with more Chaos Emeralds. Shadow goes to Central City, encountering G.U.N.'s forces after stealing an Emerald. Shadow has vowed to fulfill a promise to a girl, Maria, which he interprets as one of revenge. Shadow blasts through the military force and meets Sonic. After a brief confrontation, Shadow escapes and G.U.N. captures Sonic, whom they mistake for Shadow.

Meanwhile, Knuckles encounters Rouge and Eggman, who try to steal the Master Emerald. He stops them by shattering the Emerald and searches for the scattered shards. Rouge, spying for the government, heads to Eggman's base and the ARK. There, Shadow shows Eggman the Eclipse Cannon, another superweapon created by Gerald, and discloses his plan: to charge the cannon with Chaos Emeralds and use it to take over the world.

The publisher has emphasized how hard it's trying to get things right this time, and for many, it couldn't have chosen a better game.

Jet Set Radio was part of Sega's onslaught of new properties with an emphasis on flash and style during the second wave of Dreamcast software, but it might be one of the more obscure. It's a game that almost everyone has heard of, but I think few have actually played. This was remedied somewhat with 2002's Xbox sequel Jet Set Radio Future. Unlike Sonic Adventure or the arcade hit Crazy Taxi, Jet Set Radio HD is the chance for many to finally play a game they've only heard about.

Nostalgia has the side effect of high expectations though, and Jet Set Radio HD just can't meet them. While the flash and style of Jet Set Radio HD remains untouched and unvarnished by a dozen years of progress, the rest of it can't stand up to scrutiny. Squirrely controls, camera catastrophes, and nonsensical level design make Jet Set Radio HD a better memory than game. DJ Professor K broadcasts the Jet Set Radio pirate radio station to gangs of youths who roam Tokyo-to, skating and spraying graffiti. One gang, the GGs, competes for turf with the all-female Love Shockers in the shopping districts of Shibuya-Cho, the cyborg Noise Tanks in the Benten entertainment district, and the kaiju-loving Poison Jam in the Kogane dockyard. The authorities, led by Captain Onishima, pursue the gangs with riot police and military armaments. After the GGs defeat Poison Jam, Noise Tanks, and Love Shockers in turf wars, they each drop a piece of a mysterious vinyl record. Professor K says that the mysterious vinyl has the power to summon a demon.

The GGs are joined by Combo and Cube, who explain that their hometown, Grind City, has been overtaken by the Rokkaku business conglomerate. They ask the GGs to help them to free their friend, Coin, who has been captured by the Rokkaku. The Rokkaku pursue the GGs and steal the vinyl record. Poison Jam explains that the Rokkaku CEO, Goji Rokkaku, plans to use the record to make a contract with the demon and take over the world. The GGs defeat Goji in the rooftop of his headquarters by destroying his turntable. Freedom is returned to the streets of Tokyo-to.

Not everyone is able to enjoy the benefits of this boom, however. Despite fueling the engine of the British Empire, workers’ lives are little more than legalized slavery while the top few percent profit from their labor.

Noire is a neo-noir detective action-adventure video game developed by Team Bondi and published by Rockstar Games. It was initially released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 platforms on 17 May 2011; a Microsoft Windows port was later released on 8 November 2011.

L.A. Noire is set in Los Angeles in 1947 and challenges the player, controlling a Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) officer, to solve a range of cases across five divisions. Players must investigate crime scenes for clues, follow up leads, and interrogate suspects, and the player's success at these activities will impact how much of each case's story is revealed.

The game draws heavily from both the plot and aesthetic elements of film noir—stylistic films made popular in the 1940s and 1950s that share similar visual styles and themes, including crime and moral ambiguity—along with drawing inspiration from real-life crimes for its in-game cases, based upon what was reported by the Los Angeles media in 1947.

The game uses a distinctive colour palette, but in homage to film noir it includes the option to play the game in black and white. Various plot elements reference the major themes of detective and mobster stories such as The Naked City, Chinatown, The Untouchables, The Black Dahlia, and L.A. Confidential. Amid the post-war boom of Hollywood's Golden Age, Cole Phelps is an LAPD detective thrown headfirst into a city drowning in its own success.

Much like the first two games, the story revolves around the Saints destroying and absorbing three rival gangs, taking over the city in the process. In Saints Row: The Third, these three gangs are the Morningstar, the Luchadores, and the Deckers. Unlike the first two games, these three gangs are all controlled by a criminal organization known as The Syndicate, which the saints must also deal with. A while after the Ultor Corporation falls, the 3rd Street Saints have turned their street gang into a media empire, becoming icons and household names across the world, with their own energy drink, Japanese commercials, toys, a large fanbase, and a movie deal in the works. But when they attempt to rob a bank with actor Josh Birk, who is to play a Saint's member, their everyday routine takes an unlikely turn when the bank tellers unexpectedly start an all out gun war on the saints. The Saints attempt to airlift the vault out of the building, but when Birk foolishly sets off the alarm, it alerts the Stilwater P.D. and, after a large-scale firefight with police and S.W.A.T, the Saints are incarcerated.
In jail, Saints second-in-command Johnny Gat laments what the Saints have become, expressing disappointment at having strayed from their roots. At that point, an international criminal organization, called The Syndicate, bribes the police to release the Boss, Gat, and Shaundi. The three are forcibly taken to the Syndicate's leader Phillipe Loren, to try and negotiate a business plan with them aboard Loren's private jet. While in-flight, Loren tells them they will be allowed to live if they turn over 2/3 of the Saints' business in Stilwater. The Boss and Gat immediately reject this offer, and are able to fight their way out, with Gat commanding the plane back to Stilwater. The Boss and Shaundi use a parachute to escape the plane, but Gat is believed to be killed in the process.
Upon landing, the Boss and Shaundi find themselves in Steelport, the dystopian criminal city controlled by the Syndicate, a group of three gangs: The Morning Star, a gang with advanced technology equipment, controlled by Loren himself, the Luchadores, a Mexican gang lead by the killer wrestler Killbane, and the Deckers, a hacker-based gang led by Matt Miller. After calling Pierce Washington, the Boss's second-in-command, to Steelport, the Saints seize a Morning Star penthouse for their new headquarters, hijack a UAV from a military base, and begin attacking Morning Star's businesses, culminating with an attack on Syndicate Tower, Loren's headquarters, in which the Saints rescue Oleg Kirlov, an apparent superhuman and template for the Syndicate's Brute clones, and Loren is killed. When the Saints try to transport Gat's body to Stilwater for his funeral, Killbane, now leader of the Syndicate, leads an attack on them. The fight destroys Stilwater's Hughes Memorial Bridge in the process.
To retaliate, the player seeks out anti-Syndicate talent, recruiting Oleg as an enforcer, ex-FBI hacker Kinzie Kensington as an informant; Zimos, the oldest pimp in Steelport; and Angel de la Muerte, Killbane's vengeful former tag-team partner. They are later joined by Viola DeWynter after Killbane kills her twin sister Kiki out of rage due to a failed assassination attempt on the Boss. Her defection, however, coincides with the arrival of the paramilitary S.T.A.G. (Special Tactical Anti-Gang) forces in Steelport, created by Senator Monica Hughes after the destruction of the bridge to end gang violence once and for all. The Saints take on STAG regardless, resulting in Steelport going under martial law, whilst also dealing with the Syndicate.
After providing Kinzie with the appropriate technology, the player enters the Deckers mainframe, defeating Deckers leader Matt Miller's avatar in a virtual reality fight and driving him and most of the Deckers out of town. At Angel's insistence, the player opts to take on Killbane by killing the other contestants in his Murderbrawl XXXI pay-per-view to gain entrance, and then, with Angel's help, defeating Killbane in Murderbrawl with the option to unmask or spare him. Following his humiliating defeat, an enraged Killbane responds by instigating several attacks on the Saints and STAG throughout Steelport to cause chaos.
Whilst quelling the fighting between the Luchadores and STAG, the Boss is simultaneously informed that Killbane is escaping the city while STAG second-in-command Kia is holding Shaundi, Viola, and Mayor Burt Reynolds hostage at a Steelport monument rigged to blow to frame the Saints. The Boss kills Kia and saves Shaundi and the others, the Saints are hailed as heroes for saving the monument and STAG pulls out of Steelport with the threat that they will be back. The Boss tracks Killbane down to Mars and kill him in what is ultimately revealed to be a scene from the Saints sci-fi film Gangstas in Space, which the Boss and several members are acting in.
An alternate, non-canonical ending plays out should the player opt to eliminate Killbane. In which the destruction of the monument is used as a pretext by STAG to attack Steelport with the airborne aircraft carrier Daedalus. The Boss destroys the Daedalus, killing STAG leader Cyrus Temple in the process, and declares Steelport an independent city-state under the Saints' control, with Pierce taking charge as mayor, and the Boss as the ultimate leader.",kill stag leader cyrus temple defeat decker leader matt miller mayor burt reynolds hostage bank teller unexpectedly start airborne aircraft carrier daedalus attack morning star angel muerte fbi hacker kinzie kensington saint rescue oleg kirlov absorb rival gang command johnny gat lament saint deal,saint row saint row game city steelport game story revolve saint destroy absorb rival gang city process saint row gang morningstar luchadores decker game gang control criminal organization syndicate saint deal ultor corporation fall street saint street gang medium empire icon household energy drink japanese commercial toy fanbase movie deal attempt rob bank actor josh birk play saint everyday routine bank teller unexpectedly start gun war saint saint attempt airlift vault building birk foolishly set alarm alert stilwater pd largescale firefight police swat saint incarcerate jail saint secondincommand johnny gat lament saint expressing disappointment stray root international criminal organization syndicate bribe police release bos gat shaundi forcibly syndicate leader phillipe loren negotiate business plan aboard loren private jet inflight loren live saint business stilwater bos gat reject offer fight gat command plane stilwater bos shaundi parachute escape plane gat kill process land bos shaundi steelport dystopian criminal city control syndicate gang morning star gang advanced technology equipment control loren luchadores mexican gang lead killer wrestler killbane decker hackerbased gang lead matt miller pierce washington bos secondincommand steelport saint seize morning star penthouse headquarters hijack uav military base attack morning star business culminate attack syndicate tower loren headquarters saint rescue oleg kirlov apparent superhuman template syndicate brute clone loren kill saint transport gat body stilwater funeral killbane leader syndicate lead attack fight destroy stilwater hughes memorial bridge process retaliate player seek antisyndicate talent recruit oleg enforcer exfbi hacker kinzie kensington informant zimos pimp steelport angel muerte killbane vengeful tagteam partner viola dewynter killbane kill twin sister kiki rage fail assassination attempt bos defection coincide arrival paramilitary stag special tactical antigang force steelport create senator monica hughes destruction bridge gang violence saint stag result steelport martial law deal syndicate provide kinzie technology player enter decker mainframe defeat decker leader matt miller avatar virtual reality fight drive decker town angel insistence player opt killbane kill contestant murderbrawl xxxi payperview gain entrance angel defeat killbane murderbrawl option unmask spare follow humiliate defeat enraged killbane responds instigate attack saint stag steelport chaos quell fighting luchadores stag bos simultaneously inform killbane escape city stag secondincommand kia hold shaundi viola mayor burt reynolds hostage steelport monument rig blow frame saint bos kill kia save shaundi saint hail hero save monument stag pull steelport threat bos track killbane mar kill ultimately reveal scene saint scifi film gangsta space bos alternate noncanonical play player opt eliminate killbane destruction monument pretext stag attack steelport airborne aircraft carrier daedalus bos destroy daedalus kill stag leader cyrus temple process declare steelport independent citystate saint control pierce charge mayor bos ultimate leader

Unfortunately the prince stands a little less than half a foot tall, so recreating the stars will require some effort. Enter the Katamari, a sphere the prince can push around our world to “roll up” items increasing the Katamari’s size until it’s suitable for the King.

Taking place in stylized versions of Japanese houses, cities, and environs, the prince pushes the Katamari around collecting items which adhere to it. At first, the prince can only pick up smaller items, but as the Katamari grows, the more it can collect. Push pins and paper clips cling to the Katamari increasing its size so it can roll over obstacles and pick up bigger items. Over many levels, the Katamari can eventually pick up people, cars, and other bigger items.

Players steer the Katamari from a third-person perspective using the analog sticks on the PS2. A tutorial stage takes the player through the controls and sets up the story as well as introducing a side story about a Japanese girl who can feel the cosmos. Wanting to challenge the prince, the King sets requirements on the Katamari’s size and sets time limits on the level. Bonus missions restore constellations and have their own restrictions.

The world of Katamari Damacy is brought to life with off-beat animation and a catchy soundtrack. Players can find presents hidden in the levels that contain accessories for the prince. Two players can also battle head-to-head in a Katamari competition. The game begins with a scene of the King destroying all of the stars and the Moon.

Meanwhile, Knuckles is taking his usual walk along the Emerald altar to check if the Emeralds are alright, suddenly a huge earthquake came out of nowhere, Knuckles saw the Emeralds reverberating in mid-air, stunned, he was suddenly threw into the air before blacking out. When he woke up, the Chaos Emeralds were gone, but Knuckles also saw a huge egg in the distance, surprised, he then recalled a legend of an ancient dragon sent to destroy the world in the end times, thinking this mysterious egg to be the dragon he set out, and... A giant egg-shaped figure appeared out of nowhere, calling himself ""Dr. Eggman"", he explained to Knuckles he had come here to study this giant egg, and that an evil hedgehog named Sonic was trying to not only interfere with his research, but steal the Chaos Emeralds as well. Knuckles, duped by the doctor, ran off to find this miscreant. Eggman smiled at himself, pleased at his ability to lie.

Immediately after the event of Sonic 3 where Dr. Robotnik's orbital weapon, the Death Egg, is damaged in a battle with Sonic and crash-lands back onto Angel Island. Sonic travels through each zone looking to retrieve the Chaos Emeralds to defeat Robotnik, and once again comes into conflict with Knuckles, who believes Sonic is trying to steal the Emeralds for himself. In Hidden Palace Zone, Sonic fights and defeats Knuckles. The two hear a disturbance outside of the chamber, and go out to find Dr. Robotnik stealing the Master Emerald, the secret to the island's levitation powers. Knuckles attempts to attack Robotnik, but is electrically shocked in the process, and is trapped with Sonic in an underground passage. Knuckles, realizing Sonic is on his side, shows him a portal that leads them to Sky Sanctuary, where the Death Egg is relaunching. Sonic proceeds to infiltrate the Death Egg, and defeats Robotnik as Super Sonic.

Knuckles' story, which takes place after the events of Sonic's campaign, begins in Mushroom Hill,[b] where he is relaxing with his animal friends but is interrupted by a bomb dropped by EggRobo. This prompts Knuckles to chase after him, leading him through more difficult versions of most of the same zones Sonic went through. The chase ends at the damaged remains of Sky Sanctuary, where a robot called Mecha Sonic attacks Knuckles but accidentally destroys EggRobo instead. After a short fight, Mecha Sonic uses the power of the Master Emerald to achieve a Super form similar to Sonic's. Knuckles manages to defeat Super Mecha Sonic, who explodes. Sonic flies in piloting the biplane Tornado and Knuckles hitches a ride to return the Master Emerald to Angel Island. If all the Chaos Emeralds are collected, Angel Island rises upwards, into the sky. However, if the player has not collected all the Chaos Emeralds, Knuckles cannot redeem the Master Emerald, and Angel Island plummets into the ocean.",robot mecha sonic attack knuckle land angel island special feature unique mushroom hill accidentally destroy eggrobo angel island rise sonic complete edition massive chaos emerald defeat super mecha sonic,sonic hedgehog knuckle simply sonic knuckle sonic complete edition platform video game result lockingon sonic knuckle sonic hedgehog catridge unique lockon technology essentially combined game lockon component zone game special feature unique game original sonic hedgehog developer intend time constraint sega result game split sonic hedgehog evil dr robotnik death egg orbit hero sonic hedgehog companion mile tail prower completely destroy death egg crashlanded float island ocean island special property eponymous power magical suspension dr robotnik detect presence massive chaos emerald island depths decide seek chaos emerald fall death egg regain orbit space crush defeat sleek advantage kidnap animal convert badniks create weapon knuckle usual walk emerald altar check emerald alright suddenly huge earthquake knuckle emerald reverberate midair stun suddenly threw air black wake chaos emerald knuckle huge egg distance surprise recall legend ancient dragon send destroy time mysterious egg dragon set giant eggshaped figure dr eggman explain knuckle study giant egg evil hedgehog sonic interfere steal chaos emeralds knuckle dupe doctor miscreant eggman smile ability lie event sonic dr robotnik orbital weapon death egg damage battle sonic crashlands angel island sonic travel zone retrieve chaos emeralds defeat robotnik conflict knuckle sonic steal emerald hidden palace zone sonic fight defeat knuckle hear disturbance chamber dr robotnik steal master emerald secret island levitation power knuckle attempt attack robotnik electrically shock process trap sonic underground passage knuckle realize sonic portal lead sky sanctuary death egg relaunching sonic proceeds infiltrate death egg defeat robotnik super sonic knuckle story event sonic campaign mushroom hillb relax animal friend interrupt bomb drop eggrobo prompt knuckle chase lead difficult version zone sonic chase damage remains sky sanctuary robot mecha sonic attack knuckle accidentally destroy eggrobo short fight mecha sonic power master emerald achieve super form sonic knuckle manages defeat super mecha sonic explode sonic fly pilot biplane tornado knuckle hitch ride return master emerald angel island chaos emerald collect angel island rise sky player collect chaos emeralds knuckle redeem master emerald angel island plummet ocean

However, the sample material causes a ""resonance cascade"", devastating the facility and creating an interdimensional rift to an alien dimension called Xen, bringing its alien creatures to Earth.

Freeman survives, finds other survivors, and makes his way to the surface with the protection of his hazard suit to get help.

The player, in control of Clementine, can direct the character around the environment, examine and interact with various scenery elements and collect and use objects to advance the story. The player can also initiate conversations with non-player characters via conversation trees. Certain replies from other characters may offer the player multiple choices to select from, including the option to stay silent, with a limited amount of time to make the selection; if the player does not select an option, the conversation will continue as if they had stayed quiet. Such choices can affect how the other characters will later react to Clementine which can influence later events in the story. Other scenes are more action-oriented, requiring the player to complete quick time events to avoid Clementine or her allies from getting killed. If the player fails these events, the game will restart at the start of such scenes. Such action scenes may also require the player to make a key decision within a limited time frame, such as which of two characters to save from attacking walkers. The Walking Dead: Season Two continues the story of Clementine, a young girl orphaned by the undead apocalypse. Left to fend for herself, she has been forced to learn how to survive in a world gone mad.

Many months have passed since the events seen in Season One of The Walking Dead, and Clementine is searching for safety.

Several characters work together to steal Shinnok's amulet and imprison him inside, but eventually Mileena hatches a plan to release Shinnok by bringing the amulet to Quan Chi who escaped when Shinnok was imprisoned.

It is a reboot of the landmark video game series Prince of Persia created by Jordan Mechner, who served as creative consultant, designer, and scenario writer for The Sands of Time. King Sharaman of Persia and his son, known only as the Prince, pass through India en route to Azad and conquer a city with the aid of the local Maharajah's traitorous Vizier. During the battle the Prince seeks to win honour and glory in his first battle and heads straight to the Maharajah's treasure vaults, where he discovers the mythical Sands of Time safely contained within their Hourglass and the Dagger of Time, which he quickly learns can turn back time a short amount. When the Prince presents the dagger to his father, the traitorous Vizier demands it as payment, but is refused by King Sharaman. The Persians then continue on their journey to Azad with the wealth of prisoners taken from the Maharajah, among them the Maharajah's beautiful daughter, Princess Farah.

In Azad, the Vizier, now in the service of King Sharaman, tricks the Prince into using the Dagger to release the Sands of Time from the Hourglass. A horrific sandstorm engulfs the kingdom and the Sands of Time turn all the occupants of the palace into monsters. Only the Prince, Farah, and the Vizier remain unchanged due to their possessions; a dagger, a medallion, and a staff, respectively. Amid the catastrophe, the Vizier demands the dagger from the Prince, who refuses and manages to escape.

The Prince soon teams up with Farah in an attempt to return the Sands of Time to the Hourglass, which the Vizier moves to the top of the Tower of Dawn. As they progress through the palace the pair are constantly waylaid by Sand Monsters (including a sand-possessed King Sharaman) and the deadly network of traps set in motion in the hopes of killing the creatures. The Prince becomes steadily more worn until his princely armor is mere shreds and his body covered in bloody wounds.

While initially the Prince does not trust Farah because of the Persians' mistreatment of her, the two begin to grow closer as time goes on After a terrific battle in the ascent of the Tower of Dawn, they reach the Hourglass and are about to complete their mission when the Prince hesitates, suddenly suspicious of what Farah's motives really are. Before Farah can convince the Prince otherwise, the Vizier confronts the pair and uses his magical powers to trap Farah and the Prince in a tomb.

As they wait to die in the tomb Farah tells the Prince, who similarly reveals his claustrophobia, a story she had never told anyone before, about a time when she was little, when her mother told her about a secret magic word which would help her escape anything that scared her: ""Kakolookia"".

As soon as the Prince repeats the word, as if by magic, the Prince finds himself in a mysterious tunnel which winds down into a dreamlike bathhouse that resembles the magic fountains that the Prince earlier used to increase his health. There he meets Farah inviting him to join her bath; as they bathe, the Prince and Farah finally make love and find comfort in each other amid their perilous situation. When the Prince awakens afterwards, he finds himself back in the tomb and discovers that the magical cavern was just a dream, but he believed that Farah had shared it as well. However Farah, the Dagger, and his sword are gone, leaving him with only Farah's medallion to protect him from the Sands of Time.

The Prince, having found a new sword which destroys the sand monsters on contact, pursues and catches up to Farah once more atop the Tower of Dawn, which he must climb from the outside. When the Prince finally reaches the top, he finds Farah being overwhelmed by the sand monsters and she dangles over a cliff by the Dagger, while the Prince grab the blade; and Farah, realizing that the Prince will die to save her, instead sacrifices herself and lets go of the Dagger; and true to the game's prophecy ""if you want to live, die in love"" she falls to her death in the Hourglass room below. The Prince then tries to use the dagger to save her, but finds the sand-tanks empty since Farah had used them all. Enraged by his lover's death, the Prince uses the Dagger to massacre the last of the sand monsters in the tower and descends to weep over Farah's body. As the Prince mourns, the Vizier emerges from the shadows and offers the Prince a partnership in his evil plan, promising him eternal life; however the Prince angrily refuses because those he loved had died, and before the Vizier can stop him, the Prince drives the Dagger of Time into the Hourglass, rewinding time to the night before the invasion of the Maharajah's kingdom. The Prince awakens, still with the Dagger of Time, and secretly finds his way to Farah's bedroom, where he tells her the whole story, which she does not remember as it had not happened yet. However, the Vizier discovers the Prince, and fearing his planned treachery already revealed, attempts to kill both Farah and the Prince, telling that he suffered from consumption and would die in any event and that his plan was to cure his imminent death with eternal life. In the ensuing battle the Prince kills the Vizier. He then returns the Dagger of Time to Farah, who asks why the Prince invented such an unbelievable story to prove the Vizier's treachery. The Prince then kisses Farah, hoping she'll remember; but she rebuffs his advance, and so the Prince uses the dagger to erase the kiss, and instead he falsely tells her that it was just a story. But when Farah asks the Prince his name, he replies, ""Just call me Kakolookia"", before departing, leaving Farah amazed.",landmark video game series prince plan treachery reveal vizier remain unchanged tank farah time safely,prince persia sand time thirdperson puzzleplatformer actionadventure video game publish ubisoft reboot landmark video game series prince persia create jordan mechner serve creative consultant designer scenario writer sand time king sharaman persia son prince pas india en route azad conquer city aid local maharajah traitorous vizier battle prince seek win honour glory battle head straight maharajah treasure vault discover mythical sand time safely hourglass dagger time learn time short prince dagger father traitorous vizier demand payment refuse king sharaman persian continue journey azad wealth prisoner maharajah maharajah beautiful daughter princess farah azad vizier service king sharaman trick prince dagger release sand time hourglass horrific sandstorm engulf kingdom sand time occupant palace monster prince farah vizier remain unchanged possession dagger medallion staff catastrophe vizier demand dagger prince refuse manage escape prince team farah attempt return sand time hourglass vizier tower dawn progress palace pair constantly waylay sand monster include sandpossessed king sharaman deadly network trap set motion hope kill creature prince steadily worn princely armor mere shred body cover bloody wound initially prince trust farah persian mistreatment grow closer time terrific battle ascent tower dawn reach hourglass complete mission prince hesitate suddenly suspicious farah motif farah convince prince vizier confront pair magical power trap farah prince tomb wait die tomb farah prince reveal claustrophobia story time mother secret magic word escape scar kakolookia prince repeat word magic prince mysterious tunnel wind dreamlike bathhouse resemble magic fountains prince earlier increase health meet farah invite bath bathe prince farah finally love comfort perilous situation prince awaken tomb discovers magical cavern dream farah share farah dagger sword leave farah medallion protect sand time prince sword destroy sand monster contact pursues catch farah atop tower dawn climb prince finally reach farah overwhelm sand monster dangle cliff dagger prince grab blade farah realizing prince die save sacrifice dagger true game prophecy live die love fall death hourglass prince dagger save sandtanks farah enrage lover death prince dagger massacre sand monster tower descend weep farah body prince mourn vizier emerge shadow offer prince partnership evil plan promise eternal life prince angrily refuse love die vizier prince drive dagger time hourglass rewinding time night invasion maharajah kingdom prince awakens dagger time secretly farah bedroom story remember happen vizier discover prince fear planned treachery reveal attempt kill farah prince telling suffer consumption die event plan cure imminent death eternal life ensuing battle prince kill vizier return dagger time farah prince invent unbelievable story prove vizier treachery prince kiss farah hop remember rebuff advance prince dagger erase kiss falsely story farah prince reply kakolookia depart leave farah amaze

The gameplay is structured similarly to other games in the series and is divided into two major gameplay sections: sailing between islands and exploring the islands and their dungeons on foot. The touch screen is used to make Link move and attack instead of buttons, you can also make notes of secret treasures and items on the map simply by writing them down.

They come across a patch of ocean covered in a dense fog, in which they discover an abandoned ship. Tetra falls into danger when she explores the ship alone, and Link falls into the ocean when he attempts to rescue her.

Can Alice save Wonderland - and herself - from the madness that consumes them both? Within events of the first game, Alice Liddell, believing herself responsible for a fire that consumed her home and her family, escapes into a twisted version of Wonderland. While held at Rutledge Asylum for treatment, Alice was able to conquer her doubts, and eventually was released from the ward. Madness Returns takes place in 1875, a year after Alice's release. Alice, now 19 years old,[6] resides at an orphanage in Victorian London, under the care of Dr. Angus Bumby, a psychiatrist who uses hypnosis to help his child patients forget their memories. Though she believes that she is fine, Alice still suffers from hallucinations of Wonderland.

During an errand, Alice is struck by a hallucination and believes herself to be in Wonderland again. Though initially idyllic, the peaceful land quickly becomes corrupted by the Infernal Train that rampages through it, leaving behind the Ruin, a force that attempts to stop Alice. Alice meets with the Cheshire Cat who affirms that it is some outside force, not Alice, that has caused this corruption, and urges her to seek out former friends and foes to discover the source of the Train. Throughout the rest of the game, Alice briefly returns to reality between episodes occurring within Wonderland. In the real world, Alice learns from the family lawyer that her sister, Elizabeth (nicknamed ""Lizzie""), was first to die in the fire, despite being the farthest from its source, and had been locked in her room.

Within the corrupted Wonderland, Alice attempts to learn more from Wonderland's various citizens, including the Duchess, the Mad Hatter, the Mock Turtle, the Walrus and the Carpenter, and the Caterpillar. She is ultimately told that the Queen of Hearts still lives despite her defeat at Alice's hands before, though in a diminished capacity. At the Queen's castle, Alice discovers the Queen's true form, which resembles her younger self. The Queen reveals that an entity called the Dollmaker has taken over the Infernal Train and is corrupting Wonderland.

Returning to London, Alice starts to recall her memories of the night of the fire and realizes that Dr. Bumby was there. He is responsible for the death of her sister and her whole family. She comes to the conclusion that Dr. Bumby is attempting to erase the memories of the fire from her mind and, as he has done with other children, trying to leave her as a ""blank toy"" to be taken by abusive masters and child molesters for a price. Furious, Alice confronts both Dr. Bumby in the real world at the Moorgate station and Dr. Bumby's Wonderland counterpart, the Dollmaker, in her fantasy on the Infernal Train. Dr. Bumby admits to his crimes, and even attests to setting Alice's home on fire after Lizzie refused his advances, removing any witnesses to his having raped her that night. He points out that by wiping out her Wonderland, he will make her forget the events of that night, while he will continue as a member of high society. Alice defeats the Dollmaker in Wonderland, giving her the strength in the real world and in her mind to push Dr. Bumby into the path of an oncoming train, killing him.

As Alice leaves the station, she finds herself in a hybrid vision of London mixed with Wonderland, Londerland. Alice wanders into the unknown terrain as the Cheshire Cat monologues that Alice has found the truth that was ""worth the pain fighting for"", and Wonderland, though damaged, is safe for the time being.",peaceful land corrupted madness return heart live,return wonderland experience nightmare alice fight regain sanity fight truth alice save wonderland madness consume event game alice liddell responsible consume family escape twisted version wonderland hold rutledge asylum treatment alice conquer doubt eventually release ward madness return alice release alice resides orphanage victorian london care dr angus bumby psychiatrist hypnosis child patient forget memory fine alice suffer hallucination wonderland errand alice strike hallucination wonderland initially idyllic peaceful land corrupt infernal train rampage leave ruin force attempt alice alice meet cheshire cat affirm force alice corruption urge seek friend foe discover source train rest game alice return reality episode occur wonderland real alice learns family lawyer sister elizabeth nickname lizzie die farthest source lock corrupted wonderland alice attempt learn wonderland citizen include duchess mad hatter mock turtle walrus carpenter caterpillar ultimately told queen heart live defeat alice hand diminished capacity queen castle alice discovers queen true form resemble queen reveal entity dollmaker infernal train corrupt wonderland return london alice start recall memory night realize dr bumby responsible death sister family conclusion dr bumby attempt erase memory mind child leave blank toy abusive master child molester price furious alice confronts dr bumby real moorgate station dr bumby wonderland counterpart dollmaker fantasy infernal train dr bumby admit crime attests set alice lizzie refuse advance remove witness rap night wipe wonderland forget event night continue society alice defeat dollmaker wonderland strength real mind push dr bumby path oncoming train kill alice leave station hybrid vision london mixed wonderland londerland alice wanders unknown terrain cheshire cat monologue alice truth worth pain fighting wonderland damage safe time

Go to Boot Camp to learn the basics of Battlefield 4's engaging single player and intense multiplayer mode. Here you'll also find intel on Levolution, Commander Mode, Naval Warfare and many more exciting game features. Unlike the Campaign of its predecessor, Battlefield 4's Campaign primarily follows chronological order, and permanently casts the player as Recker. In the beginning, set in Baku, Azerbaijan, Tombstone Squad—consisting of Recker, Dunn, Irish, and Pac—escapes the city, with vital intelligence in hand and Russian special forces in hot pursuit. The squad winds up trapped in a civilian's car when it plunges into the sea. Dunn, trapped between the seats and critically wounded, gives Recker his pistol and orders him to shoot out the windshield.[35] Reluctantly, Recker shoots the window, and Dunn drowns as the others escape. As Tombstone swims to the surface, the player hears their commanding officer, Captain Garrison, talking over the phone about the intel: that Admiral Chang is planning a military coup d'état, and if he succeeds, he will gain full Russian support, confirming an earlier report from an asset in China. Tombstone returns to the USS Valkyrie, an amphibious assault carrier en route to China's eastern coast. On board, Garrison informs them of the assassination of Chinese presidential candidate Jin Jié, and that Chang convinced the Chinese that the United States was responsible.
Garrison sends Tombstone, with Recker as squad leader, on a covert mission in Shanghai to rescue three VIPs: Kovic, Hannah, and Hannah's husband. With Tombstone's help, Kovic takes his fellow VIPs to the Valkyrie by helicopter. Meanwhile, Tombstone takes a civilian tourist boat from the shore, just as an electromagnetic pulse fries all electric equipment in the area. Realizing that there are other civilian refugees stranded on boats around them, and against Pac's protests, Irish leads them to the Valkyrie. Aboard the Valkyrie, they head for the USS Titan, a Nimitz-class aircraft carrier that can assist them. Upon sighting the Titan, the Valkyrie finds it highly damaged by Chang's Chinese military. Garrison orders Tombstone, with Kovic as acting squad leader (Recker lost the position because he didn't stop Irish in Shanghai), to scour the wreckage of the Titan for vital intelligence before it sinks. Tombstone recovers a hard drive with data from before the Chinese missile attack and fight their way out against boarding Chinese soldiers. The Titan buckles under its own weight while sinking and splits in two, forcing Tombstone to jump ship. Making their way back to the Valkyrie with a hijacked assault boat, they find the carrier under siege by Chinese forces. They board it to repel the Chinese assault. Kovic is critically injured during the engagement, and puts Recker back in charge of Tombstone before he dies. Tombstone then clears the bridge and rescues Hannah's husband and Garrison.
Garrison debriefs Recker and Pac on the upcoming assault on the Chinese-controlled Singapore airfield to destroy Chinese air superiority while their air forces are grounded by a storm. Hannah volunteers to join Tombstone, much to Irish's chagrin, as he wasn't involved in the debrief himself. They successfully assault the beach and lead an advance towards the airfield, losing most of their forces in the process. While crossing a bridge to the airfield, Recker is pinned behind by a car blown by the strong winds and tries to break free with the help of Tombstone, to no avail. A large freighter crashes into the bridge, throwing Tombstone into the sea below. They survive and make their way to the airfield via a sewer. After Pac fires the signal flare, Tombstone attempts to evacuate the area using an enemy vehicle, but they are knocked out of their vehicle when the missiles hit, apparently killing Pac. Hannah seemingly betrays the squad, bringing the Chinese soldiers to capture Tombstone; this infuriates Irish, but neither he nor Recker can stop the soldiers from incapacitating them.
Recker and Irish are then taken to a prison in the Kunlun Mountains by the Chinese military. There, the two Marines are interrogated about their mission in Shanghai, with Chang personally watching, before being thrown into cells. Recker is awoken by ""Dima"", a Russian prisoner suffering from radiation poisoning. Recker helps Dima release the other prisoners, starting a mass riot throughout the prison and reuniting him with Irish. Although the prison guard is overrun, Chinese military arrive and launch an assault. Recker and Irish hold them off long enough for Dima to open the prison gates, only to be caught by Hannah and other soldiers. Hannah shoots the soldiers holding Recker, Irish and Dima at gunpoint; she explains that she had been tasked to protect Jin Jié, who had been posing as her husband. The group fight their way through the Kunlun Mountains to a cable car, which goes down the mountain. The tram is then shot down by an enemy helicopter, and the impact kills Dima.
Forced to continue on foot for two days, Tombstone makes their way down the mountain, forced to hunt for food to survive. They find a jeep and drive to Tashgar, under siege by both Chinese and Russian forces. While driving, Hannah explains that she'd brought Jin Jié to meet her family to give them hope, but that the next day, Chang's army came and killed them all; this mortifies Irish, and he apologizes to Hannah. They eventually find Major Greenland, who commands the remainder of U.S. ground forces in Tashgar. She states that the mobile anti-air that the Russians have are causing them to have a disadvantage. Tombstone volunteers to demolish the dam to flood the area, destroying the Chinese-Russian forces in exchange for a ride back to the Valkyrie. They successfully complete their task, and are sent to the Suez Canal.
They are picked up by a U.S. C-130 using the Fulton surface-to-air recovery system, and are then paradropped to the Valkyrie, which is sailing blindly into Admiral Chang's forces. Tombstone assists in clearing the deck of boarding Chinese forces and find Garrison, who is holed up with Jin Jié, other survivors, and Pac (who had survived Singapore, and escaped by ""crawling through a thousand miles of shit with a hole in [his] stomach""). When Chinese forces finally reach the door to the medical bay, Jin Jié convinces Recker to let him show his face to the soldiers, as they had been fighting under the illusion that Jin Jié had been killed. Recker opens the door and is knocked down, but Jié calms the tension between the three forces showing his face to them. The Chinese soldiers celebrate the news of their leader's return and call off the attack.
However, upon hearing this news, Chang barrages the Valkyrie with his warship, hoping to ""bury the truth and everyone with it"". With no ordinance to strike back, Recker, Irish and Hannah once again volunteer to manually destroy it with explosives. Driving a boat to the warship's blind spot, the trio set the remote charges and use grappling guns to bring them to safety under the Suez Canal Bridge before detonating the explosives. Unfortunately, the remote detonation fails, requiring manual replacement of the charges. Hannah volunteers to set a new charge, but Irish stops her, volunteering to do it himself because China will need Hannah. Recker—and the player—is forced to take two options: either do nothing as Chang's warship obliterates the Valkyrie, thus killing Pac, Garrison and Jin Jié; or to send either Hannah or Irish back down to set the explosives. As soon as the detonator lights green, Recker detonates the charges, destroying Chang's ship but killing whomever had gone down to make it possible. A U.S. rescue helicopter then picks up Recker and his remaining teammate, reporting to Garrison that one member is missing in action. During the credits, the player hears a new dialogue between Irish and Hannah, discussing their pasts, and how they have to keep moving forward with ""no fucking regrets"".",campaign follow

His weapon of choice is his shotgun. He is assisted by another man called Chumbucket. Chum mainly works with Max to build and upgrade the Magnum Opus vehicle.

Mad Max will feature a variety of weapons which Max can use to defeat enemies. Though the shotgun is Max's weapon of choice, ammo is scarce, and so melee options are the smarter way to go. The 'thunderstick' is an explosive weapon that can be lanced into an enemy's chest, crackling like a lit dynamite fuse before blowing the victim to smithereens. The Harpoon is also one of Max's favorite weapon though it can only be used in-vehicle with Chum riding along. Max's Magnum Opus can be combined with a speedy V12 engine and powerful ramming ability to destroy enemies's vehicles and weaponry. When simultaneously driving and aiming, the game enters slow-motion and allows you to toggle between targets. Not much is known about the vehicular combat and its features.

Mad Max will feature crafting system which can be used to craft new weapons and tools. Max's garage can also be used to change and modify the car's engines, chassis, wheels, body works including paint treatment and the “shell” of the auto-mobile and the car’s weight and attributes update accordingly. Max can also be upgraded though it's plans hasn't fully been implemented.

Many choices are given in the game, such as, either playing silently or aggressively. Max can also get guidance from Chum about how he can complete his objectives strategically. However, its largely up to the player how he can complete the objectives. Max must traverse a barren desert wasteland in search for his lost treasured vehicle, the Pursuit Special (also referred to as The Interceptor).",body include paint treatment chumbucket titular character mad max,mad max player role titular character mad max dangerous melee fighter attack kill weapon choice shotgun assist chumbucket chum max build upgrade magnum opus vehicle mad max feature variety weapon max defeat enemy shotgun max weapon choice ammo scarce melee option smart nothunderstick explosive weapon lance enemy chest crackle lit dynamite fuse blow victim smithereens harpoon max favorite weapon invehicle chum rid max magnum opus combine speedy engine powerful ram ability destroy enemy vehicle weaponry simultaneously drive aim game enter slowmotion toggle target vehicular combat feature mad max feature craft craft weapon tool max garage change modify car engines chassis wheel body include paint treatment automobile car weight attribute update max upgrade plan implement choice game play silently aggressively max guidance chum complete objective strategically player complete objective max traverse barren desert wasteland search lost treasure vehicle pursuit special refer interceptor

The game follows the protagonist, a young teenager named Jak, as he tries to help his friend Daxter after he is transformed into an ""other"", a fictional hybrid of an otter and a weasel.

The game offers a large range of missions, collectables and objectives, often in the form of minigames, which provide a variety of gameplay experiences, as well as puzzles and platforming stages, which are completed by the player to proceed with the story. The opening sequence of the game features Jak and Daxter in a speedboat headed for Misty Island, an area prohibited by their watch over Samos. Upon arriving to the island, Daxter had second thoughts about straying from the village. The two perch on a large skeleton to observe a legion of lurkers crowded around two dark figures, Gol and Maia, who were commanding the lurkers to ""deal harshly with anyone who strays from the village,"" and to search for any precursor artifacts and eco near Sandover Village.[4] After the secret observation, Jak and Daxter continue searching the island. Daxter trips on a dark eco canister which he tosses to Jak after expressing his dislike for the item, and as Jak caught the object it lit up. Shortly afterwards a bone armor lurker suddenly confronted the two, where Jak threw the dark eco canister at the lurker, killing it, but inadvertently knocked Daxter into a dark eco silo behind him. When Daxter reemerged, he was in the form of an ottsel, and upon realizing the transformation he began to panic.",lurker crowd dark figure bone armor lurker suddenly confront platform video game develop dark eco silo teenager jak eco sandover village,jak daxter precursor legacy platform video game develop naughty dog publish sony entertainment sony playstation december game jak daxter series game follow protagonist teenager jak friend daxter transform fictional hybrid otter weasel game offer range mission collectable objective form minigames provide variety gameplay experience puzzle platforming stage complete player proceed story sequence game feature jak daxter speedboat head misty island prohibit watch samos arrive island daxter stray village perch skeleton observe legion lurker crowd dark figure gol maia command lurker deal harshly stray village search precursor artifact eco sandover village secret observation jak daxter continue search island daxter trip dark eco canister toss jak express dislike item jak catch object light shortly bone armor lurker suddenly confront jak throw dark eco canister lurker kill inadvertently knock daxter dark eco silo daxter reemerged form ottsel realize transformation panic

Catch-a-ride on the lunar landscape with new vehicles equipped with deadly weapons allowing for more levels of destructive mayhem. So grab a friend (or two, or three), strap on a rocket, and take off on a brand new Borderlands adventure The opening of The Pre-Sequel begins some time after the events of Borderlands 2, and immediately after Episode 3 of the subsequent game Tales from the Borderlands, on the flying city of Sanctuary, where the three former Vault Hunters Lilith, Brick, and Mordecai interrogate the ex-Atlas assassin Athena after having captured her. Athena recounts her story, starting after the death of General Knoxx, when she received an offer to go find a Vault on Pandora's moon, Elpis, from a Hyperion programmer named Jack. She joins fellow Vault Hunters Claptrap, Nisha, Wilhelm, Timothy, and Aurelia on a spaceship headed for the Hyperion moon base Helios. On the way, they are ambushed by the Lost Legion, an army of former Dahl marines led by Colonel Tungsteena Zarpedon, and crash-land onto the moon base. After meeting up with Jack, they attempt to use Helios' defense system against the Lost Legion, but realizes there is a jamming signal coming from Elpis. They attempt to escape, but they are stopped by Zarpedon and a mysterious alien warrior, so Jack stays behind to fend them off and sends the Vault Hunters to Elpis via a moonshot rocket.

After landing on Elpis, the Vault Hunters are helped by Janey Springs, a junk dealer who guides them to the spaceport town Concordia. Here, the Hunters, under Jack's orders, request help from his ex-girlfriend Moxxi to find the jamming signal. After raiding a former Dahl station, they find out that the signal was put up by the Meriff, the person in charge of Concordia, as well as Jack's former Hyperion underling. While this is happening, Zarpedon activates Helios' primary weapon, the Eye of Helios, which fires a powerful beam on the surface of Elpis, stating she plans to destroy the moon to stop Jack from opening the Vault. Jack confronts and kills the Meriff at his office. With Concordia secured, Jack and Moxxi guide the Vault Hunters to the next step in retaking Helios. They infiltrate a Lost Legion base, run by two Dahl officers, the Bosun and the Skipper, in search of a military artificial intelligence, which Jack plans to use to build a robot army. After defeating the Bosun, it is revealed that the Skipper, who renames herself Felicity, is the A.I. they were looking for. The Vault Hunters travel to a robot production facility, where Jack enlists the help of another Hyperion scientist named Gladstone to build his robot army. Gladstone suggests using his prototype robot, named the Constructor, which has the ability to build an infinite number of robots. At first, Felicity agrees to help them by becoming the A.I. for the Constructor, but upon witnessing the violence she has to go through, she begins to hesitate. After being forced into the Constructor bot, she takes control of it and battles the Vault Hunters. Felicity is defeated, and her personality is deleted from the Constructor bot.

Having obtained his robot army, Jack and the Vault Hunters travel to Helios, while enlisting the aid of Moxxi and two former Vault Hunters, Roland and Lilith (who were on Elpis for a vacation). While on Helios, Jack ruthlessly kills Gladstone and the other scientists working for him after suspecting one of them to be a spy for the Lost Legion. The Vault Hunters defeat Zarpedon and her forces, and proceed to reboot the Eye of Helios. It is revealed that the Eye is actually the eye of the Destroyer, the monster that was released from Pandora's Vault in the first game, in which Jack took and made into a weapon. The Vault Hunters inject slag(Eridium runoff made by Hyperion) into the Eye, under Moxxi's directions. When attempting to reboot, Moxxi, Roland and Lilith betray Jack and destroy the Eye to prevent him from gaining ultimate power. Seeking revenge, Jack and the Vault Hunters travel back to Elpis, where they find its Vault having already been opened, as mentioned by Zarpedon before her death. The Hunters battle several of the Vault's guardians, and defeat its ultimate guardian, the Deva-like Empyrean Sentinel.

With the Sentinel dead, Jack enters the Vault, but finds no item of value, other than a mysterious symbol floating in midair. As he interacts with it, the symbol shows Jack a vision of the Warrior. However, he is interrupted by Lilith, who phasewalks in front of him and punches through the Vault symbol, burning it onto Jack's face and disfiguring him. She teleports away, leaving a scarred and insane Jack behind, who swears vengeance on Lilith and all the ""bandits"" on Pandora, now intent on awakening the Warrior to take over the planet. Realizing that the hero who once saved her on Helios is no more, Athena leaves Jack's employ.

Having finished listening to Athena's story, Lilith orders the Crimson Raiders to execute her, against Brick and Mordecai's protests. However, as they open fire on her, Athena is saved by the alien warrior who appeared on Helios with Zarpedon, revealed to be one of the legendary Eridians. The Eridian warns the Vault Hunters of an imminent war, and that they will need ""all the Vault Hunters they can get"".

During the credits, several scenes are shown revealing what became of the Vault Hunters after helping Jack. Wilhelm and Nisha join Jack in his rise to power; Wilhelm is transformed further into a machine and destroys the settlement of New Haven while Nisha is made Lynchwood's sheriff and hooks up with Jack, who proceeds to raise an army, Athena discards the money given to her by Jack and leaves Elpis, and Claptrap is dismantled and left for dead by Jack at Windshear Waste. In a post-credit scene, Jack, now going by the name Handsome Jack and wearing a synthetic mask to hide his facial scarring, kills his CEO, Harold Tassiter, and announces to Tassiter's secretary on an intercom that he has replaced him as the new head of Hyperion.",lotta gameplay feature hyperion scientist gladstone fellow vault hunter claptrap vault hunter lilith dahl marine lead story borderland vault hunter inject slag vault hunter travel hyperion programmer jack brand borderland adventure jack ruthlessly kill gladstone,shoot loot brand adventure rocket pandora moon borderlands presequel discover story borderland villain handsome jack rise power brand game borderland series original borderland borderlands presequel lotta gameplay feature genre fusion shooter rpg gameplay player gravity launch moonscape enemy ice laser weapon catcharide lunar landscape vehicle equip deadly weapon level destructive mayhem grab friend strap rocket brand borderland adventure presequel time event borderland episode subsequent game tale borderland fly city sanctuary vault hunter lilith brick mordecai interrogate exatlas assassin athena capture athena recount story starting death knoxx receive offer vault pandora moon elpis hyperion programmer jack fellow vault hunter claptrap nisha wilhelm timothy aurelia spaceship head hyperion moon base helios ambush lose legion army dahl marine lead colonel tungsteena zarpedon crashland moon base meet jack attempt helios defense lost legion realizes jamming signal elpis attempt escape zarpedon mysterious alien warrior jack stay fend send vault hunter elpis moonshot rocket land elpis vault hunter janey spring junk dealer guide spaceport town concordia hunter jack request exgirlfriend moxxi jamming signal raid dahl station signal meriff person charge concordia jack hyperion underling happen zarpedon activates helios primary weapon eye helios powerful beam surface elpis plan destroy moon jack vault jack confronts kill meriff office concordia secure jack moxxi guide vault hunter step retake helios infiltrate lose legion base dahl officer bosun skipper search military artificial intelligence jack plan build robot army defeat bosun reveal skipper rename felicity vault hunter travel robot production facility jack enlist hyperion scientist gladstone build robot army gladstone prototype robot constructor ability build infinite robot felicity agree constructor witness violence hesitate force constructor bot control battle vault hunter felicity defeat personality delete constructor bot robot army jack vault hunter travel helios enlist aid moxxi vault hunter roland lilith elpis vacation helios jack ruthlessly kill gladstone scientist suspect spy lose legion vault hunter defeat zarpedon force proceed reboot eye helios reveal eye eye destroyer monster release pandora vault game jack weapon vault hunter inject slageridium runoff hyperion eye moxxi direction attempt reboot moxxi roland lilith betray jack destroy eye prevent gain ultimate power seek revenge jack vault hunter travel elpis vault mention zarpedon death hunter battle vault guardian defeat ultimate guardian devalike empyrean sentinel sentinel dead jack enter vault item mysterious symbol float midair interact symbol jack vision warrior interrupt lilith phasewalks punch vault symbol burn jack disfigure teleport leave scarred insane jack swear vengeance lilith bandit pandora intent awaken warrior planet realizing hero save helios athena leaf jack employ finish listen athena story lilith crimson raider execute brick mordecai protest athena save alien warrior helios zarpedon reveal legendary eridians eridian warn vault hunter imminent war vault hunter credit scene reveal vault hunter jack wilhelm nisha jack rise power wilhelm transform machine destroy settlement nisha lynchwood sheriff hook jack proceed raise army athena discard money jack leave elpis claptrap dismantle leave dead jack windshear waste postcredit scene jack handsome jack wear synthetic mask hide facial scarring kill ceo harold tassiter announces tassiter secretary intercom replace head hyperion

The NieR:Automata Game of the YoRHa Edition includes the game itself and comes packed with DLC and bonus content for the full experience of the award-winning post-apocalyptic action RPG, including:
- 3C3C1D119440927 DLC*

The first and second playthroughs follow the respective views of 2B and 9S during an initial invasion. After opening a route for future missions, they are sent to clear out machine threats for the Resistance, led by Anemone, who provides the two with support. During their missions, 2B and 9S discover that the machines are exploring human societies and concepts. The two work with a pacifist machine group led by Pascal; battle Adam and Eve, physical manifestations of the machine network who reveal that their creators were destroyed centuries ago and encounter A2, a rogue android on the run from YoRHa. Adam is killed by 2B after he captures 9S. During his recuperation, 9S discovers a glitch in YoRHa's servers when syncing himself and 2B, and learns that humanity was extinct long before the alien invasion. Their last remnant is a Moon-based server holding humanity's incomplete genome remains. YoRHa perpetuates the myth of their survival to maintain morale and give androids a ""god"" to fight for. With Adam dead, Eve goes mad with grief and drives the machines under his command into a frenzy. 2B and 9S kill Eve to end the rampage, but 9S becomes infected with Eve's logic virus, forcing 2B to kill him. However, 9S's consciousness survives within the local machine network.

The third playthrough begins as YoRHa launches a full-scale invasion. A logic virus attack—enabled by the ""glitch"" that 9S previously discovered—corrupts every YoRHa unit including those in the Bunker, except for 2B and the restored 9S. 2B and 9S are separated in the aftermath, and 2B is infected with the logic virus. Discovered by A2, 2B uploads her memories into her sword and asks her to look after 9S. An ignorant 9S witnesses A2 mercifully killing 2B and swears revenge on her. Simultaneously, a tower created by the machines rises from the land, separating the two before they can fight. The perspective splits between A2 and 9S a fortnight after these events. A2—the survivor of a test run for YoRHa—finds herself empathising with the machines; she witnesses Pascal's village being destroyed, then its ""children"" committing suicide out of fear when attacked. Pascal begs A2 to either wipe his memory or kill him; A2 can perform either task or leave him. An increasingly-unbalanced 9S investigates the tower's resource-gathering platforms, fighting machine remnants and learning the tower is designed to launch a missile at the Moon server. Both eventually enter the tower, with Devola and Popola sacrificing themselves to open it.",discover corrupts yorha unit include ignorant witness mercifully kill logic virus attack enable retro red pod skin retro grey pod skin play pod skin amazarashi head pod skin base server hold humanity pacifist machine lead,nierautomata story android battle reclaim machinedriven dystopia overrun powerful machine nierautomata game yorha edition include game pack dlc bonus content experience awardwinning postapocalyptic action rpg include ccd dlc cardboard pod skin retro grey pod skin retro red pod skin grimoire weiss pod machine mask accessory pc version valve character accessory exclusive set wallpaper size version play pod skin amazarashi head pod skin dynamic theme psn avatar playthroughs follow respective view initial invasion route future mission send machine threat resistance lead anemone provide support mission discover machine explore human society concepts pacifist machine lead pascal battle adam eve physical manifestation machine network reveal creator destroy century encounter rogue android yorha adam kill capture recuperation discover glitch yorha server sync learn humanity extinct alien invasion remnant moonbased server hold humanity incomplete genome remain yorha perpetuate myth survival maintain morale android god fight adam dead eve mad grief drive machine command frenzy kill eve rampage infect eve logic virus force kill consciousness survives local machine network playthrough yorha launch fullscale invasion logic virus attack--enabled glitch discovered--corrupts yorha unit include bunker restored separate aftermath infect logic virus discover upload memory sword ignorant witness mercifully kill swears revenge simultaneously tower create machine rise land separate fight perspective split fortnight event a--the survivor yorha--finds empathise machine witness pascal village destroy child commit suicide fear attack pascal begs wipe memory kill perform task leave increasinglyunbalanced investigate tower resourcegathering platform fight machine remnant learn tower design launch missile moon server eventually enter tower devola popola sacrifice

With the enhanced remake Pokémon Platinum, the games comprise the fifth installment and fourth generation of the Pokémon series of RPGs. First released in Japan on September 28, 2006, the games were later released to North America, Australia, and Europe over the course of 2007.

Like previous Pokémon games, Diamond and Pearl chronicle the adventures of a young Pokémon trainer as he/she trains and battles Pokémon while also thwarting the schemes of a criminal organization. The games add many new features, such as Internet play over the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection and changes to battle mechanics and Pokémon Contests, along with addition of 107 new Pokémon. The games are independent of each other but feature largely the same plot and while both can be played separately, it is necessary to trade between them in order to complete the games' Pokédexes. The games chronicle the adventures of a new Pokémon trainer who strives to become the Pokémon League Champion by collecting and training Pokémon. Like most games in the series, Diamond and Pearl feature eight Pokémon gyms led by Gym Leaders, professional trainers whose expertise lies in a particular Pokémon type. Gym Leaders (Roark, Gardenia, Maylene, Wake, Fantina, Byron, Candace, and Volkner) serve as bosses and reward skilled trainers with Gym badges, key to the advancement of the plot. As in Ruby and Sapphire, the protagonist must also thwart the schemes of a crime syndicate (and here, it is Team Galactic), who plans to use Pokémon to restructure the region into a utopia.

Like all other Pokémon RPGs, Diamond and Pearl begin in the protagonist's hometown. After viewing a television report about a media-conducted search for a Red Gyarados, which was spotted at a faraway lake (Johto's Lake of Rage) the protagonist and his or her best friend travel together to check the local lake for a Pokémon like it. They spot Professor Rowan, a Pokémon evolution researcher, and his assistant, the playable character not selected in the game: Lucas (boy) or Dawn (girl). After a short discussion, the professor and his assistant leave the lake, leaving a briefcase behind. When they are attacked by wild Starly, the protagonist and his or her rival examine the case. The player is then given a choice among the three Pokémon found in the briefcase (Turtwig, Chimchar, or Piplup) with which to battle the Starly. After defeating the Starly, Lucas or Dawn retrieves and returns the briefcase to the professor. Noticing that a bond has been forged between the young protagonist and his or her chosen Pokémon, Rowan offers it to him or her, asking that he or she embark on a journey and fill his or her Pokédex.

The protagonist encounters the main antagonist, Team Galactic, early in the game, when he or she must save Professor Rowan from its thugs; however, its motives are unclear until later. The protagonist encounters the Team twice (when it takes over a wind farm and when it sets up a base in Eterna City) before it takes over Sinnoh's three lakes in an attempt to capture the Mirage Pokémon (Uxie, Azelf, and Mesprit). Shortly after the player earns his or her seventh Gym Badge, Team Galactic captures the Mirage Pokémon and imprisons them inside the science laboratory of the Team Galactic Headquarters Building, where its members extract crystals from the Pokémon to create the Red Chain, an object that can control the legendary Pokémon Palkia (in Pearl) or Dialga (in Diamond) (both in Pokémon Platinum, though Giratina appears after this). After releasing the trio, the protagonist is able to access the cave atop Mt. Coronet, where the leader of Team Galactic awakens Dialga or Palkia. The legendary Pokémon's powers begin to overwhelm Sinnoh, causing the newly free Uxie, Azelf, and Mesprit to attempt to stop it. The player then battles Palkia/Dialga; after defeating or capturing the Pokémon, Sinnoh returns to normal. After this, the player will continue, eventually battling the Sinnoh Region Pokémon League's Elite Four: Aaron, Bertha, Flint, and Lucian. After defeating all four members, the player will battle the Sinnoh League champion, a woman named Cynthia, who had appeared before in the game. If the protagonist beats Cynthia, he or she is the new Sinnoh League champion, beating the game. After the player beats the game, there is a new island to explore that is filled with other types of Pokémon. His or her old friend, who challenged him or her to battles multiple times before, will be waiting for him or her here. The old friend will challenge the player to another battle. On this island, there are also stores and a tournament center.",pearl feature pokemon gym lead professional trainer expertise lie game add feature friend travel team galactic headquarters building enhance remake pokemon platinum save professor rowan sinnoh league champion protagonist thwart team galactic awakens dialga,pokemon diamond version pearl version roleplay game rpgs develop game freak publish nintendo nintendo enhanced remake pokemon platinum game comprise installment fourth generation pokemon series rpgs release japan september game release north america australia europe previous pokemon game diamond pearl chronicle adventure pokemon trainer heshe train battle pokemon thwart scheme criminal organization game add feature internet play nintendo wifi connection change battle mechanic pokemon contest addition pokemon game independent feature plot play separately trade complete game pokedexes game chronicle adventure pokemon trainer strive pokemon league champion collect train pokemon game series diamond pearl feature pokemon gym lead gym leader professional trainer expertise lie pokemon type gym leader roark gardenia maylene wake fantina byron candace volkner serve boss reward skilled trainer gym badge key advancement plot ruby sapphire protagonist thwart scheme crime syndicate team galactic plan pokemon restructure region utopia pokemon rpgs diamond pearl protagonist hometown view television report mediaconducted search red gyarados spot faraway lake johto lake rage protagonist friend travel check local lake pokemon spot professor rowan pokemon evolution researcher assistant playable character select game lucas boy dawn girl short discussion professor assistant leave lake leave briefcase attack wild starly protagonist rival examine player choice pokemon briefcase turtwig chimchar piplup battle starly defeat starly lucas dawn retrieves return briefcase professor noticing bond forge protagonist chosen pokemon rowan offer embark journey pokedex protagonist encounter main antagonist team galactic game save professor rowan thug motif unclear protagonist encounter team wind farm set base eterna city sinnoh lake attempt capture mirage pokemon uxie azelf mesprit shortly player earn seventh gym badge team galactic capture mirage pokemon imprisons science laboratory team galactic headquarters building extract crystal pokemon create red chain object control legendary pokemon palkia pearl dialga diamond pokemon platinum giratina release trio protagonist access cave atop coronet leader team galactic awakens dialga palkia legendary pokemon power overwhelm sinnoh newly uxie azelf mesprit attempt player battle palkiadialga defeat capture pokemon sinnoh return normal player continue eventually battle sinnoh region pokemon league elite aaron bertha flint lucian defeat player battle sinnoh league champion woman cynthia game protagonist beat cynthia sinnoh league champion beat game player beat game island explore type pokemon friend challenge battle multiple time wait friend challenge player battle island store tournament center

Players assume the role of the unyielding protagonist, NIER, resolute in his quest to discover a cure for his daughter, who is infected with the Black Scrawl virus. With powerful allies and a mysterious book, NIER encounters things that will confound even the mightiest of warriors. With NIER, experience seamless in-battle cinematics and explore hauntingly familiar lands, intense action-packed battles, and storytelling like only Square Enix can do The game opens with a prologue during the summer of 2049 in a snowstorm. In a modern, broken-down grocery store, Nier (Jamieson Price) fends off attacks from ethereal monsters to protect his sick young daughter, Yonah (Heather Hogan). After defeating the monsters, he checks on Yonah, who has begun to cough badly. The game then cuts to 1,312 years later, where the player sees what appears to be the same two characters, now living in a village built upon the ruins of an old town. The low-technology village is one of several, and is surrounded by more modern ruins such as the remnants of train tracks and industrial machinery. The areas between towns are filled with monsters known as Shades that attack travelers.
As Yonah's illness, the Black Scrawl, is terminal, Nier sets out to look for a cure. As he does, Nier finds a talking book, Grimoire Weiss (Liam O'Brien), which suggests that the two team up to use Weiss' magic and to find a cure for Yonah's disease. In their search, they encounter Kainé (Laura Bailey), a hot-tempered and foul-mouthed swordswoman; and Emil (Julie Ann Taylor), a blindfolded boy whose eyes petrify anyone they see. After journeying for a time, the village is attacked by a giant shade; the battle culminates in Yonah being carried away by a master Shade that suddenly appears—the Shadowlord—who carries his own book, Grimoire Noir.
The game then jumps five years forward. Nier and the others are trying to find the parts to a key that they believe will help them locate the Shadowlord and Grimoire Noir. After defeating five Shades and assembling the key, the team go to defeat the Shadowlord. There, Devola and Popola (both voiced by Eden Riegel), characters who have been guiding Nier on his quest, appear to try to stop them. They explain that over 1300 years prior, humanity faced extinction due to an incurable disease. In an attempt to survive, they separated their souls from their bodies using Grimoire Noir and Weiss. They created clones resistant to the disease, Replicants, and intended to recombine the souls, or Gestalts, with the Replicant bodies once it had died out; Devola and Popola were androids set to oversee the project. Over time, the Replicants had begun to form their own identities; while the Gestalts, or Shades, had grown aggressive to them.[7]
Nier defeats the pair, with Emil sacrificing himself to ensure his friends' progress. The remaining group then defeats the Shadowlord, and the player discovers that he is the Gestalt form of the Nier from the prologue. Driven to protect his Yonah, he was the first Gestalt and has combined her with the Replicant Yonah. The original Yonah, however, tells the Gestalt Nier that she can hear the new Yonah inside her, and that she loves the Replicant Nier and deserves the body just as much.[8] She vacates the body, and Nier and Yonah are reunited.
If the player plays the game again, they start just after the five-year skip. They learn about Kainé's past, including that she is intersex, which along with the death of her parents resulted in her ostracism as a child, and that she is partially possessed by a Shade. The player gains the ability to understand what the shades are saying, including the one possessing Kainé, though in-game Nier, Weiss, and Emil are still unable to. Additional cutscenes are also shown, giving the motivations and backstory behind the Shade bosses that are fought and showing them as sentient people trying to defend their friends against Nier. The ending to the second playthrough shows that Emil survives his sacrifice, and that Gestalt Nier and Yonah are reunited in the afterlife. A third playthrough presents the player with a choice in the ending to save Kainé, who is seen to be dying in agony; Nier can either kill her to end her suffering, or sacrifice his life for her. The latter choice not only erases all memory of him from the other characters' minds, shown in a final cutscene, but also deletes all of the player's saved progress, as if the game had never been played. Moreover, if the player wants to start a new game, they will be unable to enter the same name chosen for the previous playthrough for the Nier character.",blindfold boy eye petrify humanity extinction explore hauntingly familiar land julie ann taylor jump eden riegel character late action adventure game body grimoire noir,square enix late action adventure game set crumbling plague disease dark unrecognizable creature player assume role unyielding protagonist nier resolute quest discover cure daughter infect black scrawl virus powerful ally mysterious book nier encounter confound mighty warrior nier experience seamless inbattle cinematics explore hauntingly familiar land intense actionpacked battle storytelling square enix game prologue summer snowstorm modern brokendown grocery store nier jamieson price fends attack ethereal monster protect sick daughter yonah heather hogan defeat monster check yonah cough badly game cut player character live village build ruin town lowtechnology village surround modern ruin remnant train track industrial machinery town monster shade attack traveler yonah illness black scrawl terminal nier set cure nier talk book grimoire weiss liam obrien team weiss magic cure yonah disease search encounter kaine laura bailey hottempered foulmouthed swordswoman emil julie ann taylor blindfolded boy eye petrify journey time village attack giant shade battle culminate yonah carry master shade suddenly appears--the shadowlord--who carry book grimoire noir game jump nier key locate shadowlord grimoire noir defeat shade assemble key team defeat shadowlord devola popola voice eden riegel character guide nier quest explain prior humanity extinction incurable disease attempt survive separate soul body grimoire noir weiss create clone resistant disease replicants intend recombine soul gestalt replicant body die devola popola android set oversee project time replicants form identity gestalt shade grow aggressive nier defeat pair emil sacrifice ensure friend progress remain defeat shadowlord player discover gestalt form nier prologue driven protect yonah gestalt combine replicant yonah original yonah gestalt nier hear yonah love replicant nier deserve body vacate body nier yonah reunite player play game start fiveyear skip learn kaine include intersex death parent result ostracism child partially possess shade player gain ability understand shade include possessing kaine ingame nier weiss emil unable additional cutscenes motivation backstory shade boss fight sentient people defend friend nier playthrough emil survive sacrifice gestalt nier yonah reunite afterlife playthrough player choice save kaine die agony nier kill suffering sacrifice life choice erase memory character mind final cutscene delete player saved progress game play player start game unable enter chosen previous playthrough nier character

When time breaks, catastrophe becomes your playground. As hero Jack Joyce, you'll fight your way through epic disasters that stutter back and forth in time. But surviving this unstable world--and halting the end of time itself--is only possible by mastering your new time powers. ""Time has been broken. A Fracture in time, created by a time travel experiment that has gone wrong, is advancing at an inexorable pace. As a result, time itself is now stuttering to a halt and then restarting, causing the world to turn into a frozen tableau. Most are unaware of the imminent disaster.

Jack Joyce is not one of these people: changed by the same experiment, he can see the damage as the Fracture advances; time keeps slipping more and more out of joint and as the world loses synchronization, destruction on a massive scale ensues.

Going from ordinary to extraordinary overnight isn't something to take lightly. With these powers does one exact revenge? Protect the innocent? Or perhaps, dabble in a little of both? The choice is yours in Infamous. inFAMOUS is set in Empire City, a fictional metropolis based on New York City, consisting of the Neon District, where most of Empire City's businesses are concentrated, the Warren, a slum dependent on international shipping activity, and the Historic District, the location of the city government. Each district has an elevated train system and a separate power grid. The premise of the game is built around the partial destruction of the Historic District by a mysterious explosion, followed by a viral epidemic that forces federal authorities to seal the only bridge leading to the mainland. A rise in violent crime overwhelms the police, resulting in societal collapse.

Characters
The protagonist is Cole MacGrath (Jason Cottle), a courier who is accused of triggering the explosion, which leaves him with the ability to absorb and project electricity. His closest friend, Zeke Jedediah Dunbar (Caleb Moody), allows Cole to hide on his rooftop, despite his envy of the former's powers. Trish Dailey (October Moore), Cole's girlfriend, abandons him out of anger over the death of her sister Amy, while most of Empire City's residents view him as a terrorist. While attempting to escape the city with Zeke, Cole is contacted by FBI agent Moya Jones (Kimberli Colbourne), who offers to clear his name if he helps her find her husband, fellow agent John White (Phil LaMarr). White vanished while investigating a group known as the First Sons, who are believed to be responsible for orchestrating the explosion.

While working to restore order in the Neon District, Cole encounters Sasha (Jessica Straus), a former member of the First Sons, who like Cole is a ""Conduit"", an individual given powers by the First Sons. Using her ability to control the minds of others via a tar-like substance, she has formed a gang known as the Reapers. Meanwhile, the Warren has been overrun by the Dust Men, an army of homeless militants led by Alden Tate (also Jason Cottle), the original leader of the First Sons, who possesses telekinesis. Kessler (Sam A. Mowry), the true antagonist of the game, is a shadowy figure who controls the First Sons and who takes an obsessive interest in Cole and his powers.

Story
While the basic story of InFamous remains unchanged whether the player opts for the ""Good"" or ""Evil"" karma path, there are some story elements that change depending on Cole's choices.

While making a delivery in the Historic District, Cole is instructed to open the package. In doing so, he activates a device known as the Ray Sphere, leveling six city blocks and nearly killing him. Rescued by Zeke and Trish, he teaches himself to control his emerging powers. After using them in public to fight off a Reaper attack, the locals turn against Cole after he is accused of triggering the explosion, forcing him into hiding. He and Zeke engineer an assault on the sealed bridge, only to be ambushed by government forces. Separated from his friend, Cole meets Moya, who persuades him to return and find John. With her help, Cole restores the district's power supply, earning the attention of Sasha, who lures him into her underground lair. Cole defeats her, but she is abducted by the Sons before he can make her talk. Trapped in the Warren, Cole assists what remains of the police in battling the Dust Men. Alden is arrested and imprisoned, but Zeke's incompetence in guarding him allows the Dust Men to free him and massacre most of the officers. With Alden planning to reactivate the Sphere, the two patch things up and confront him, with Zeke ending up in possession of the Sphere. Giving in to his temptations, Zeke deserts Cole and takes the Sphere to Kessler.

With Alden on a murderous rampage towards the Historic District, Cole defeats him once and for all in a bridge battle. Before jumping in the water, Alden reveals that Kessler exiled him from the First Sons. White, who turns out to be an NSA agent with no connection to Moya, reaches out to Cole and explains that the Ray Sphere is designed to consume bio-energy from thousands of lives and transfer it to a single user, making them a Conduit. During their search for the Sphere, Kessler publicly challenges Cole to stop a series of bombings across the district, ending with him being forced to choose between saving Trish or her colleagues. Regardless of which choice he makes, Cole fails to keep Trish from dying. Determined to punish Kessler, Cole tracks the Sphere to a remote pier, where he must decide whether to destroy it or use it to become even more powerful. Regardless, the Sphere releases the last of its energy, killing John before disappearing into a vortex.",caleb moody cole jason cottle level city block fbi agent moya jones october moore cole fellow agent john white kessler publicly challenge cole,infamous single player openworld actionadventure game role cole mcgrath regular guy aftermath horrific catastrophe alive develop fantastic array superpower ordinary extraordinary overnight lightly power exact revenge protect innocent dabble choice infamous infamous set empire city fictional metropolis base york city consisting neon district empire city business concentrate warren slum dependent international shipping activity historic district location city government district elevate train separate power grid premise game build partial destruction historic district mysterious explosion follow viral epidemic force federal authority seal bridge lead mainland rise violent crime overwhelms police result societal collapse character protagonist cole macgrath jason cottle courier accuse trigger explosion leave ability absorb project electricity close friend zeke jedediah dunbar caleb moody cole hide rooftop envy power trish dailey october moore cole girlfriend abandon anger death sister amy empire city resident view terrorist attempt escape city zeke cole contact fbi agent moya jones kimberli colbourne offer husband fellow agent john white phil lamarr white vanish investigate son responsible orchestrate explosion restore neon district cole encounter sasha jessica straus son cole conduit individual power son ability control mind tarlike substance form gang reaper warren overrun dust army homeless militant lead alden tate jason cottle original leader son possess telekinesis kessler sam mowry true antagonist game shadowy figure control son obsessive cole power story basic story infamous remains unchanged player opts evil karma path story element change depend cole choice delivery historic district cole instruct package activate device ray sphere level city block kill rescue zeke trish teach control emerge power public fight reaper attack local cole accuse trigger explosion force hide zeke engineer assault seal bridge ambush government force separate friend cole meet moya persuade return john cole restore district power supply earn attention sasha lure underground lair cole defeat abduct son talk trap warren cole assist remain police battle dust alden arrest imprison zeke incompetence guard dust massacre officer alden planning reactivate sphere patch confront zeke possession sphere temptation zeke desert cole sphere kessler alden murderous rampage historic district cole defeat bridge battle jump water alden reveals kessler exile son white nsa agent connection moya reach cole explain ray sphere design consume bioenergy life transfer single user conduit search sphere kessler publicly challenge cole series bombing district force choose save trish colleague choice cole fails trish die determine punish kessler cole track sphere remote pier decide destroy powerful sphere release energy kill john disappear vortex

But nobody wanted to eat her cookies, not even the raccoons in the back of the local T&T store. So she practiced for a while, and after she baked a hundred cookies, the recipe was solid enough that she convinced her family to try them. This gave her the confidence to enlist some of the older ladies in the village to help her bake cookies.

Milca's business grew so large that she needed to buy most of the farmland around the village to raise wheat for flour and dairy cows for butter. Some of this land didn't yield as much as expected, but no worries: she chose that as the location for her new factory. Other land ended up rich in minerals for making fertilizer, leading her to start a mining operation on the side.

The game is set in the Marvel Universe and features a blend of strategy, role-playing, and card-based combat mechanics.

In the game, players take on the role of ""The Hunter,"" a customisable original character, and lead a team of Marvel superheroes. The story revolves around battling the demonic forces of Lilith, the Mother of Demons, who has been resurrected by the nefarious group Hydra.

The gameplay involves strategic, turn-based combat, where players use a deck of ability cards to perform attacks, skills, and buffs. Between missions, players can explore the Abbey, the game's hub area, where they can interact with other heroes, upgrade abilities, and make decisions that affect the story and character relationships. Hydra scientist Doctor Faustus resurrects Lilith, hoping to use her to help Hydra conquer the world. Six months later, the ""Midnight Sun"" approaches Earth, destabilizing magic and heralding the return of Lilith's master, Chthon. Doctor Strange, Tony Stark, and Carol Danvers attempt to retrieve a page of the Darkhold from Johnny Blaze but are forced to retreat to the Abbey to recruit the Midnight Suns and resurrect the Hunter, Lilith's child and killer.

Lilith enthrals Venom to help her abduct Wanda Maximoff and destroy Strange's mystic shield. The heroes, joined by Spider-Man, capture Faustus to learn Lilith's plans, but Hydra operative Crossbones kills him before they can get answers. Meanwhile, Lilith enthrals Bruce Banner and Wanda, using a gamma accelerator to empower them. The heroes rescue Wanda, banish Sabretooth, and destroy the Parchment, but Lilith unleashes the demonic Hulk and summons demons worldwide.

The heroes confront Lilith, who reveals her plan to destroy Chthon but inadvertently allows him to possess the Hunter. The Hunter expels Chthon, and Lilith sacrifices herself to destroy the Darkhold, restoring her human form.

Meet new and old characters in a tale that steps closer to its end, chapter by chapter. Dodge bullets in nonviolent RPG battles as you listen to funky, funky music. Deltarune's narrative is comprised of seven chapters, each forming its own arc. In the game's story, the players control Kris, a human teenager. They live in a town inhabited by monsters, which has hidden links to mysterious ""Dark Worlds"", where most of the story takes place.

Chapter 1 – The Beginning

Upon starting, the player constructs a humanoid ""vessel"", but it is discarded, and they are told that their choices don't matter. Instead, they take the role of Kris, who wakes up and is dropped at school by their adoptive monster mother Toriel. Kris's teacher sends Kris and delinquent Susie to get chalk. Upon entering the supply closet, both of them are pulled into the Dark World. They meet the dark prince Ralsei, who tells them that the three are heroes destined to close the Dark Fountain and restore balance to the world, which has been corrupted by its King.

Wanting to go back home, Susie refuses to help. Before she can leave, the three encounter King's son, Lancer, who tries to stop them with various ill-thought-out plans, and convinces Susie to join him. As Kris and Ralsei make their way to King's castle, they convince Susie and Lancer to fight with them, but Lancer refuses to confront his father, so he captures the others in King's dungeon.

Susie escapes and confronts Lancer, who wanted to keep Susie and King from hurting each other. She promises not to hurt King and frees Kris and Ralsei. They ascend the castle and after a lengthy battle, King falls over in exhaustion and Ralsei heals him in pity. Taking advantage, King incapacitates and threatens to kill the heroes. If the player won against all enemies without violence, Lancer turns King's subjects against him and imprisons him, taking his father's place as king of the Dark World. Otherwise, Susie subdues King using Ralsei's Pacify spell. Kris closes the Dark Fountain so that they can return to their own world, and says goodbye to Susie.

After Kris goes to bed, they limp to the center of the room, and rip out their heart-shaped SOUL, throwing it into a cage. Turning to the screen, they draw a knife and smile, with one eye flashing red.

Chapter 2 – A Cyber's World

The next day, Kris and Susie return to school to find that the town has lost Internet service. To confirm that the Dark World is real, they return to the supply closet and reunite with Ralsei, but he convinces them to leave and do their school project. To do so, Kris and Susie head to the library to meet their classmates Noelle and Berdly.

Upon going to the library's computer lab, they enter a technology-themed Dark World, ruled by a computer called Queen. She kidnaps Noelle, who also entered the Dark World along with Berdly, with the intention of turning her into the next ""Knight"", a being capable of creating Dark Fountains. Berdly joins Queen due to his attraction to both her and Noelle; Kris, Susie, and Ralsei proceed to fight him.

After some time, Kris becomes separated from their friends, and finds Noelle hiding from Queen.

Shortly after Kris rejoins Susie and Ralsei, Queen imprisons them and traps Noelle in a tower. Lancer helps Kris and Susie escape, but as Lancer is in the wrong Dark World, he turns to stone. They find Berdly, who is guilted into changing sides, and the four devise a plan to rescue Noelle. It fails, and Queen fights Kris, Susie, and Ralsei. They are ultimately outsmarted, but Noelle stands up to Queen, making her surrender. Ralsei warns Queen about the ""Roaring""—the awakening of cataclysmic ""Titans"" that will occur if too many Fountains are created—causing her to abandon her plans. Noelle thanks Susie for rescuing her, showing a desire to form a relationship. Kris and Susie then close the new Dark Fountain, while Queen and her followers relocate to Ralsei's realm.

Kris and Susie return to the real world, where they convince Noelle and Berdly that their adventure was a dream. Susie offers to walk Kris back home and is invited inside by Toriel. In the bathroom, Kris tears out their SOUL again and climbs out a window. Once Kris returns and replaces their SOUL, Toriel discovers that her minivan's tires have been slashed, and suggests that Susie sleep over. They all fall asleep in the living room, but during the night, Kris wakes up and rips out their SOUL once again. Kris then uses their knife to open a Dark Fountain, and a new Dark World engulfs the living room.

Chapter 2 – A Cyber's World Alternative Route

After finding Noelle, the player can have her magically freeze all enemies they encounter. This allows Kris to be more aggressive during dialogue, forcing her to solve puzzles by herself. After performing a specific set of actions, and upon starting a second battle with Berdly, the player can harass Noelle until she uses an unknown spell that freezes him fully. Instead of Queen capturing the group, her castle is taken over by the advertiser Spamton. Noelle is too exhausted to participate in Queen's plans, and Ralsei informs the latter of the Roaring preemptively. Kris then goes to seal the Fountain, but is stopped by Spamton's upgraded form Spamton NEO, who intends to keep it open; Noelle eventually arrives and freezes him. In the real world, Berdly is found unresponsive in the computer lab, and Noelle begins to question the nature of her ""nightmare"".",susie subdues king ralsei eye flashing red adoptive monster mother toriel walk kris upgrade form spamton neo,undertale parallel story deltarune meet character tale step close chapter chapter dodge bullet nonviolent rpg battle listen funky funky music deltarune narrative comprise chapter form arc game story player control kris human teenager live town inhabit monster hide link mysterious dark story chapter start player construct humanoid vessel discard choice matter role kris wake drop school adoptive monster mother toriel kris teacher sends kris delinquent susie chalk enter supply closet pull dark meet dark prince ralsei hero destine close dark fountain restore balance corrupt king susie refuse leave encounter king son lancer illthoughtout plan convinces susie kris ralsei king castle convince susie lancer fight lancer refuse confront father capture king dungeon susie escape confronts lancer susie king hurt promise hurt king kris ralsei ascend castle lengthy battle king fall exhaustion ralsei heals pity advantage king incapacitates threaten kill hero player win enemy violence lancer king subject imprisons father king dark susie subdues king ralsei pacify spell kris close dark fountain return goodbye susie kris bed limp center rip heartshaped soul throw cage screen draw knife smile eye flashing red chapter cyber day kris susie return school town lose internet service confirm dark real return supply closet reunite ralsei convince leave school project kris susie head library meet classmate noelle berdly library lab enter technologythemed dark rule queen kidnap noelle enter dark berdly intention knight capable create dark fountain berdly queen attraction noelle kris susie ralsei proceed fight time kris separate friend noelle hide queen shortly kris rejoins susie ralsei queen imprisons trap noelle tower lancer kris susie escape lancer wrong dark stone berdly guilted change devise plan rescue noelle fail queen fight kris susie ralsei ultimately outsmart noelle stand queen surrender ralsei warn queen roaring--the awakening cataclysmic titan occur fountain created--causing abandon plan noelle susie rescue desire form relationship kris susie close dark fountain queen follower relocate ralsei realm kris susie return real convince noelle berdly adventure dream susie offer walk kris invite toriel bathroom kris tear soul climb window kris return replaces soul toriel discovers minivan tire slash susie sleep fall asleep living night kris wake rip soul kris knife dark fountain dark engulf living chapter cyber alternative route noelle player magically freeze enemy encounter kris aggressive dialogue force solve puzzle perform specific set action start battle berdly player harass noelle unknown spell freeze queen capture castle advertiser spamton noelle exhaust participate queen plan ralsei informs roar preemptively kris seal fountain spamton upgraded form spamton neo intend noelle eventually arrive freeze real berdly unresponsive lab noelle question nature nightmare

The game was released worldwide for the Wii in November 2010. Another version featuring different gameplay was also released on the Nintendo DS at the same time. Doctor Eggman opens an amusement park in space called Dr. Eggman's Incredible Interstellar Amusement Park, allegedly turning over a new leaf and making up for past transgressions. The park is made up of several planet-sized attractions. Suspicious, Sonic the Hedgehog and his best friend Tails investigate. They meet Yacker, who comes from a species of aliens known as Wisps. After Tails invents a translator to communicate with him, they learn that other Wisps have been enslaved by Eggman, who plans to harness their energy for a mind-control laser that will allow him to take over Earth.

Sonic proceeds to visit the planets, liberating the Wisps and shutting down the generators linked to the amusement park. He meets many of his friends along the way, who are also exploring the park in an attempt to disrupt Eggman's plans. After Sonic frees the Wisps, Eggman tries to fire the cannon at the world, but a piece of wreckage causes it to malfunction. As the amusement park begins to explode, Sonic confronts Eggman. Eggman uses the Nega-Wisps to power his final contraption, a robot that uses the powers of all the Wisps that Sonic has met against him. As the machine gets weaker, the Wisps escape and help Sonic defeat Eggman, sending him hurtling off into space. The Wisps carry Sonic out of the exploding amusement park. Returning safely to Earth, Yacker thanks Sonic and Tails.

However, Sonic and Tails soon learn that the leading Mother Wisp had been infected by the negative energy and transformed into the Nega-Mother Wisp. Using the power of the Chaos Emeralds, Sonic transforms into Super Sonic and fights her. Following her defeat, the Mother Wisp returns to normal and the Wisps part ways with the two heroes. In a post-credits scene, Eggman is seen stranded in space with his henchmen Orbot and Cubot.",version feature gameplay friend tail investigate incredible interstellar amusement park,sonic color title sonic colour european australian market platforming game sonic hedgehog series develop sonic team publish sega game release worldwide wii november version feature gameplay release nintendo time doctor eggman amusement park space dr eggman incredible interstellar amusement park allegedly leaf transgression park planetsized attraction suspicious sonic hedgehog friend tail investigate meet yacker specie alien wisp tails invents translator communicate learn wisp enslave eggman plan harness energy mindcontrol laser earth sonic proceeds visit planet liberate wisp shut generator link amusement park meet friend explore park attempt disrupt eggman plan sonic wisp eggman cannon piece wreckage malfunction amusement park explode sonic confronts eggman eggman negawisps power final contraption robot power wisp sonic meet machine weak wisp escape sonic defeat eggman send hurtle space wisp carry sonic explode amusement park return safely earth yacker sonic tail sonic tails learn lead mother wisp infect negative energy transform negamother wisp power chaos emeralds sonic transforms super sonic fight follow defeat mother wisp return normal wisps hero postcredits scene eggman strand space henchman orbot cubot

Isaac, a child, and his mother live in a small house on a hill, both happily keeping to themselves, with Isaac drawing pictures and playing with his toys, and his mother watching Christian broadcasts on television. Isaac's mother then hears ""a voice from above"", stating her son is corrupted with sin, and needs to be saved. It asks her to remove all that was evil from Isaac, in an attempt to save him. His mother obliges, taking away his toys, drawings, and even his clothes.

The voice once again speaks to Isaac's mother, stating that Isaac must be cut off from all that is evil in the world. Once again, his mother obliges, and locks Isaac inside his room. Once more, the voice speaks to Isaac's mother. It states she has done well, but it still questions her devotion, and requests she sacrifice her son. She obliges, grabbing a butcher's knife from the kitchen and walking to Isaac's room. Isaac, watching through a sizable crack in his door, starts to panic. He finds a trapdoor hidden under his rug and jumps in, just before his mother opens his bedroom door. Isaac then puts the paper he was drawing onto his wall, which becomes the title screen.

During the game's loading points, Isaac is shown curled up in a ball, crying. His thoughts are visible, ranging among rejection from his mother and humiliation from his peers to a scenario involving his own death.

Gravity Rush Remastered is the PS4 remaster of the original Gravity Rush game which is bundled with all the previously released downloadable content. The game opens with an amnesiac Kat waking up in Hekseville, a floating city around a structure called the World Pillar. Kat is accompanied by a mysterious cat names Dusty; in saving a boy from being swept up in a gravity storm, she discovers that Dusty has the ability to manipulate how gravity affects her, enabling her to help people fight monsters spawned from the storms called Nevi. After saving Syd, a police officer who becomes her friend, she learns that those with her powers are dubbed ""Shifters"" by Hekseville's people. As she begins helping the city's denizens, she is confronted by fellow Shifter Raven, who sees her as an enemy. Kat becomes involved in operations to catch Alias, a criminal linked to the Nevi — she eventually defeats him, sending him into a garbage crusher where he is killed. Alongside this, Kat helps restore sections of Hekseville swallowed by spatial rifts with the aid of Gade, a man who claims to be a ""Creator"". Kat restores all of Hekseville despite further interference from Raven, who apparently dies during a fight with Kat. Her exploits earn her the name ""Gravity Queen"". Following Alias' defeat and the return of the final missing part of Hekseville, Kat is offered a place in the city's military if she will follow orders of its commander, Yuri Gerneaux, but she refuses.

Kat then meets a woman who dropped the last letter she received from her deceased boyfriend over the edge of Hekseville. To find it, she travels inside the World Pillar, a gigantic column that supports Hekseville and stretches from the sky to below the clouds. On her way down, her Shifter powers fade, and she is confronted by Raven, but the two are attacked by Nushi, a giant Nevi. Kat wakes to find herself captive in Boutoume, a city beneath the Pillar, where a group of children are living under the protection of their leader Zaza. Kat and Raven help protect the children from Nushi, but they learn that the dark sea beneath Boutoume is slowly rising. One of the children, Cyanea, later confronts Kat — in a trance, while possessed by a being called a Dream Guardian, she reveals herself to be the Creator of the world through her dreams, and sends Kat into a dream where she learns that she is from a higher part of the World Pillar where she held a powerful position and suffered due to a great burden.

Having regained some of her forgotten power, Kat activates a ship called the Ark, which can transport everyone back to Hekseville. As the Ark launches after Kat beats back Nushi, Kat learns that Raven was originally one of the children trapped in Boutoume, and that she had been told by Hekseville's city alderman D'nelica not to retrieve them. On the way up, Kat succumbs to exhaustion and is separated from the Ark. Making her way back up the World Pillar, she ends up receiving the letter she was sent for from the boyfriend's ghost. Returning to Hekseville, she finds that a whole year has passed due to the temporal distortions experienced in the lower parts of the World Pillar—under constant Nevi attacks, Hekseville has come under martial law and D'nelica has become its mayor. Kat is forced to fight Nushi one last time, before it is destroyed by an enhanced military operative called Yunica. Syd has become part of the military after its absorption of the civilian police forces. Offered a second chance to join the military efforts against the Nevi, Kat again refuses. She is then asked by a scientist to help gather data about the Nevi, but it is a ruse to find out more about her Shifter powers.

After suffering from a nightmare about Alias, Kat wakes to find that Cyanea has reappeared, although Raven and the rest of the children are still missing. Attending a rally with Gabe and Syd where D'nelica unveils the Nevi-destroying weapon Sea Anemone, Kat responds to a Nevi attack and is captured by Yunica together with Dusty. As Syd attempts to free her, the Sea Anemone — which was constructed with a Nevi core as part of D'nelica's plan to control both Hekseville and the Nevi — goes berserk and begins attacking the city. Cyanea's Dream Guardian self decides to intervene and frees Dusty, who subsequently frees Kat. Kat manages to damage the Sea Anemone, first with help from Yunica, who uses her mechanical weapons to damage its armor; then from Cyanea and Gabe as they combine their powers with Kat's to summon the Ark as a missile. D'nelica activates the Sea Anemone's self-destruct function, heedless of the collateral damage, but Kat, Raven and Yunica are able to stop it before that happens, and fling it at Neu Hiraleon, where it explodes. The people hail Kat as their savior, while calling for the wounded D'nelica's resignation for his part of the fiasco. The children within the Ark remain in stasis, with Cyanea saying they will wake to help restore light to the world; D'nelica learns Kat's original identity through a red crystal in his possession; and Gerneaux remembers a prophecy about a harbinger of catastrophe falling from the world above, referring to Kat's appearance.",people fight monster spawn fight nushi time enhance military operative yunica release downloadable content adventure video game develop mysterious cat dusty destroy weapon sea anemone kat restore nevi berserk late confronts kat,gravity rush actionadventure video game develop sie japan studio project siren publish sony entertainment gravity rush remastered ps remaster original gravity rush game bundle release downloadable content game amnesiac kat wake hekseville floating city structure pillar kat accompany mysterious cat dusty save boy sweep gravity storm discover dusty ability manipulate gravity affect enable people fight monster spawn storm nevi save syd police officer friend learn power dub shifter hekseville people city denizens confront fellow shifter raven enemy kat involve operation catch alias criminal link nevus eventually defeat send garbage crusher kill kat restore hekseville swallow spatial rift aid gade claim creator kat restore hekseville interference raven die fight kat exploit earn gravity queen follow alias defeat return final hekseville kat offer city military follow commander yuri gerneaux refuse kat meet woman drop letter receive deceased boyfriend edge hekseville travel pillar gigantic column support hekseville stretch sky cloud shifter power fade confront raven attack nushi giant nevus kat wake captive boutoume city beneath pillar child live protection leader zaza kat raven protect child nushi learn dark sea beneath boutoume slowly rise child cyanea confronts kat trance possess dream guardian reveal creator dream send kat dream learn pillar hold powerful position suffer burden regain forgotten power kat activate ship ark transport hekseville ark launch kat beat nushi kat learn raven originally child trap boutoume hekseville city alderman dnelica retrieve kat succumbs exhaustion separate ark pillar receive letter send boyfriend ghost return hekseville pass temporal distortion experience pillar--under constant nevus attack hekseville martial law dnelica mayor kat force fight nushi time destroy enhanced military operative yunica syd military absorption civilian police force offer chance military effort nevi kat refuse scientist gather data nevus ruse shifter power suffer nightmare alias kat wake cyanea reappear raven rest child attend rally gabe syd dnelica unveil nevidestroying weapon sea anemone kat respond nevi attack capture yunica dusty syd attempt sea anemone construct nevi core dnelica plan control hekseville nevi berserk attack city cyanea dream guardian decides intervene dusty subsequently kat kat manages damage sea anemone yunica mechanical weapon damage armor cyanea gabe combine power kat summon ark missile dnelica activate sea anemone selfdestruct function heedless collateral damage kat raven yunica happen fling neu hiraleon explode people hail kat savior wounded dnelica resignation fiasco child ark remain stasis cyanea wake restore light dnelica learn kat original identity red crystal possession gerneaux remembers prophecy harbinger catastrophe fall refer kat appearance

If the guests accept, they must survive mortal combat against the Librarians that guard the building; if they win, they can take any book they want. If they lose, they will become a book themselves.

Based on the plot of the movie Spider-Man 2 and the heroes and villains created by Marvel, the game allows players to encounter unique and dangerous villains as they patrol the streets and rooftops of the biggest city created in any Super Hero game to date.

As Spider-Man, players must master new combo moves as they protect the denizens of New York City from the nefarious Doc Ock and other classic Marvel villains by swinging, jumping and wall-crawling through 19 new levels that extend beyond the film. With an unprecedented depth of gameplay, players experience original storylines featuring Vulture, Shocker, Rhino, and Mysterio all while battling through graphically rich 3D environments. The console version of Spider-Man 2 is a third-person action-adventure video game, set in an open world based on New York City and composed of Manhattan, Roosevelt Island, Ellis Island, and Liberty Island. Players take on the role of Spider-Man and complete missions—linear scenarios with set objectives—to progress through the story.

The story is divided into multiple chapters, each with its own set of objectives, such as purchasing upgrades for Spider-Man, or acquiring a certain number of hero points from completing side missions. These side missions are given by random pedestrians across the game's map, and mainly consist of battling criminals, stopping speeding cars by jumping on top of them and punching them, taking injured people to the hospital, or saving construction workers from falling to their deaths. Each chapter includes at least one story mission related to the main plot.

Players are able to web swing, crawl walls, and fight enemies using a variety of combos. They can use Spider-Man's ""spider sense"" to slow down time and dodge incoming attacks, including gun fire. This version of the game was considered innovative at that time due to its physics-based algorithms that simulate Spider-Man's web swinging in three dimensions, creating a new game mechanic unlike the traditional jumping or flying of previous Spider-Man games. Combat is far more complex, as it involves carefully timing the player's attacks and dodges. After completing the main storyline, a bonus mode inside a warehouse is unlocked, where the player can fight waves of enemies and bosses from the main storyline, as well as an exclusive villain: Calypso.",player experience original storyline feature vulture player master combo story mission relate complete mission linear scenario manhattan graphically rich environment game mechanic,console version spiderman manhattan gamer playground role spiderman battle nefarious doc ock base plot movie spiderman hero villain create marvel game player encounter unique dangerous villain patrol street rooftop city create super hero game spiderman player master combo protect denizen york city nefarious doc ock classic marvel villain swing jumping wallcrawling level extend film unprecedented depth gameplay player experience original storyline feature vulture shocker rhino mysterio battle graphically rich environments console version spiderman thirdperson actionadventure video game set base york city compose manhattan roosevelt island elli island liberty island player role spiderman complete missions--linear scenario set objectives--to progress story story divide multiple chapter set objective purchase upgrade spiderman acquire hero complete mission mission random pedestrian game map consist battle criminal speed car jump punch injured people hospital save construction worker fall death chapter include story mission relate main plot player swing crawl wall fight enemy variety combo spiderman spider sense slow time dodge incoming attack include gun version game innovative time physicsbased algorithm simulate spiderman swing dimension create game mechanic traditional jumping flying previous spiderman game combat complex involve carefully time player attack dodge complete main storyline bonus mode warehouse unlocked player fight wave enemy boss main storyline exclusive villain calypso

During the operation, Zussman is stabbed, keeping him on the sideline.

Zussman returns to duty to partake in Operation Cobra, where the Allied forces successfully push to reclaim the town of Marigny. The squad is ordered by Colonel Davis to conduct a joint operation with Special Operations Executive British officers Major Arthur Crowley and Vivian Harris to intercept a German train carrying V2 rockets, near Argentan. Daniels and Zussman derail the train, before being escorted back to their squad by a French Resistance leader named Rousseau.

A week later, Rousseau and Crowley infiltrate a German garrison in Paris to retrieve explosives, in preparation of the squad's assault on the garrison. Midway, Rousseau kills SS-und Polizeiführer Heinrich, in retaliation for killing her family. The squad then successfully liberates Paris.

Two months later, the squad takes over a German-occupied hotel in the city of Aachen. They discover civilians inside the hotel, and Turner orders their evacuation, to Pierson's dismay. A young girl named Anna goes missing, and Daniels searches for her. German soldiers open fire on a truck carrying the civilians, killing Anna's older sister. Pierson sends the truck away without protection, creating a rift with Turner.

At the Battle of Hürtgen Forest, the platoon is ordered to take Hill 493. Turner splits the platoon into two groups; Pierson and Zussman are tasked with advancing towards the hill, while Turner and Daniels cover them until they can meet at the bottom. Turner's squad soon receives a transmission revealing that Pierson ordered an attack on the hill against Turner's orders. The platoon destroys an artillery position but the Germans counter-attack with a Tiger II tank. Daniels is knocked out trying to disable the tank, which is destroyed by tank commander Staff Sergeant Augustine Pérez. Turner is fatally wounded rescuing Daniels, and orders Daniels to abandon him while he covers the platoon's escape. Pierson becomes head of the platoon and makes Daniels his second-in-command, promoting him to Corporal.

At the height of the Battle of the Bulge, the platoon is surrounded by Germans. Daniels meets an African-American technician, Howard, who helps the platoon contact air support. The platoon captures several German soldiers and discovering that the Germans were ordered to destroy a bridge at Remagen, the last bridge over the Rhine. After destroying the explosives in transit, Pierson orders the platoon to attack a nearby air base to destroy the remaining explosives. The attack fails, resulting in Daniels and Zussman surrounded by enemy troops. Daniels is saved by Howard, while Zussman is captured and taken to a German POW camp, Stalag IX-B. In Stalag IX-B, Zussman is interrogated on his Jewish heritage by SS officer Metz, then beaten and sent to a POW labor camp. Daniels is hospitalized due to his wounds.

In the hospital, Daniels learns from Davis about the events that changed Pierson in the Battle of Kasserine Pass. After recovering, Daniels confronts Pierson in his tent and tears up his honorable discharge papers in order to rejoin the platoon. They successfully capture the last bridge over the Rhine. The platoon heads into Germany, liberating concentration camps in search for Zussman, eventually reaching the Berga labor camp, which they find abandoned. The camp's survivors were sent on a death march. Daniels finds and saves Zussman by killing Metz before he can execute him.

At the end of the war, Daniels parts ways with his platoon and returns to Texas, reuniting with his wife and newborn son. Daniels names his son Joseph Turner to honor the late lieutenant. He visits the grave of his older brother, Paul, who died fighting off a wolf to protect Red when the latter was still a kid. He places his Bronze Star medal on the grave, saying that his brother deserves it for showing him what it means to be a hero.",definitive war generation experience game mode special operation executive british officer major arthur crowley united army private class ronald girl anna tank commander staff sergeant augustine perez iconic war battle standalone game experience technician grade frank aiello french resistance leader rousseau infantry division private class robert zussman german train carry rocket platoon capture german soldier war german soldier technical sergeant william pierson truck protection ally force push fatally wound rescuing daniel lieutenant joseph turner platoon contact air support tiger tank,duty wwii create definitive war generation experience game mode campaign multiplayer cooperative featuring stun visuals campaign transport player european theater engage allnew duty story set iconic war battle multiplayer mark return original bootsonthe ground duty gameplay authentic weapon traditional runandgun action immerse vast array war iithemed location cooperative mode unleash original story standalone game experience unexpected adrenalinepumping moment june united army private class ronald red daniel infantry division storming normandy beach squad consisting private class robert zussman friend private draw stile technician grade frank aiello technical sergeant william pierson lieutenant joseph turner operation zussman stab sideline zussman return duty partake operation cobra allied force push reclaim town marigny squad colonel davis conduct joint operation special operation executive british officer major arthur crowley vivian harris intercept german train carry rocket argentan daniel zussman derail train escort squad french resistance leader rousseau week rousseau crowley infiltrate german garrison paris retrieve explosive preparation squad assault garrison midway rousseau kill ssund polizeifuhrer heinrich retaliation kill family squad liberate paris month squad germanoccupied hotel city aachen discover civilian hotel turner evacuation pierson dismay girl anna daniel search german soldier truck carry civilian kill anna sister pierson send truck protection create rift turner battle hurtgen forest platoon hill turner split platoon pierson zussman task advance hill turner daniel cover meet turner squad receive transmission reveal pierson attack hill turner platoon destroy artillery position german counterattack tiger tank daniel knock disable tank destroy tank commander staff sergeant augustine perez turner fatally wounded rescuing daniel daniel abandon cover platoon escape pierson head platoon daniel secondincommand promote corporal height battle bulge platoon surround german daniel meet africanamerican technician howard platoon contact air support platoon capture german soldier discover german destroy bridge remagen bridge rhine destroy explosive transit pierson platoon attack nearby air base destroy remain explosives attack fail result daniel zussman surround enemy troop daniel save howard zussman capture german pow camp stalag ixb stalag ixb zussman interrogate jewish heritage ss officer metz beaten send pow labor camp daniel hospitalize wound hospital daniel learn davis event change pierson battle kasserine pas recover daniels confronts pierson tent tear honorable discharge paper rejoin platoon capture bridge rhine platoon head germany liberate concentration camp search zussman eventually reach berga labor camp abandon camp survivor send death march daniel save zussman kill metz execute war daniel platoon return texas reunite wife newborn son daniel names son joseph turner honor late lieutenant visit grave brother paul die fight wolf protect red kid bronze star medal grave brother deserve hero

Alex is himself infected by the virus, which has given him special, mutant, abilities that will evolve with time and aid him in stopping the virus. The game follows Alexander J. Mercer (voiced by Barry Pepper) who wakes up in a morgue in the basement of Gentek, a genetic engineering company based in Manhattan, sending a pair of scientists that were just about to perform an autopsy running. Alex escapes, and witnesses the scientists being gunned down by military operatives. Alex is discovered and attacked. He survives bullets being fired into his chest, and leaps over a wall to safety. He soon discovers he now possesses powerful shapeshifting abilities, superhuman strength, speed, agility, durability, senses, endurance, weaponry and the ability to ""consume"" people to gain their memories, skills and appearance. With no memory of his previous life, Alex decides to find and consume those related to the conspiracy in order to uncover the truth. During his quest, Alex faces two factions: the United States Marine Corps and Blackwatch, a Fort Detrick special forces unit dedicated to combating biological warfare; and the Infected, monsters created by a virus known as BLACKLIGHT that is overrunning Manhattan. Captain Robert Cross (voiced by Jeffrey Pierce), a Blackwatch officer, is given orders to find and contain Alex.

Alex makes contact with his sister, Dana (voiced by Lake Bell), who assists him in tracking down targets, leading to the infiltration of Gentek headquarters. He finds a young woman called Elizabeth Greene contained in the building. Greene is a host for BLACKLIGHT and upon her escape unleashes it upon Manhattan. Dana directs Alex to Karen Parker, his ex-girlfriend. She agrees to aid him in stopping the virus, while requiring Alex to bring back samples of the virus. Karen later leads Alex into a trap, where he is confronted by Cross. During their battle, Alex almost defeated Cross when Cross mentioned 'Penn Station', triggering a flashback that leaves Alex dazed. Alex is injected with a parasite that threatens to kill him. Alex seeks help from Dr. Ragland, a pathologist linked to Gentek. Ragland helps Alex remove the parasite and turn it into a weapon against Greene. However, it has no effect on Greene as her body rejected the parasite immediately, and the rejected biomass forms a monstrous being, the Supreme Hunter, which Alex kills.

The origins of the virus and Elizabeth Greene are uncovered through a contact: in 1969 the government tested the virus' predecessor in Hope, Idaho, designed to target predetermined races. The virus mutated into something far more deadly, and the whole population was infected. Elizabeth Greene was the sole survivor; an anomaly in her body's biology accepted the virus, rewriting her genetic code along with that of her unborn son, codenamed PARIAH. The remaining population of Hope, Idaho, was liquidated by Blackwatch. Greene and PARIAH were kept in captivity for further research.

Alex discovers his own past: Blackwatch shut down the Gentek project due to leaks and ordered all project personnel eliminated. Alex Mercer took a sample of BLACKLIGHT as ""insurance"". Eventually pinned down by Blackwatch in Penn Station. Alex, in a final act of desperation and vengeance shatters the vial containing the BLACKLIGHT, releasing the virus before being gunned down. The virus entered Mercer's bloodstream through the bullet holes and repaired his body at the cellular level.

The contact and Alex pump a new ""BLOODTOX"" biological agent underground in order to drive the virus above ground where it can be fought directly, causing Greene to emerge, encased in a towering monstrosity. Greene falls from the monster in human form once she is defeated, and is consumed by Alex. Through her memories, it becomes apparent that General Randall, head of Blackwatch, is prepared to destroy Manhattan with a nuclear weapon. The contact, revealed to be Cross. Alex with the Captains help, infiltrates the USS Ronald Reagan to stop Randall. Once Alex consumes Randall, Cross is revealed to be the Supreme Hunter, who assumed Cross' identity after consuming him, and attacks Alex, asserting that when Blackwatch leaves NYZ they will no longer be searching for infected, and that after he consumes Alex, he will then be strong enough survive the nuclear detonation. Alex defeats the Supreme Hunter and moves the weapon out into the Atlantic Ocean with a helicopter, where it detonates and catches him in the blast. His remains float back to the city and regenerate after consuming a crow.

During the credits, it is revealed that the public considers the military to have been the one who stopped the infection; a US Senator is heard telling the media that the events in Manhattan were a case of nuclear and biological terrorism, and promises retribution upon those responsible. Alex, reflecting on the events that occurred and the truth he uncovered about himself, claims he has ""become something less than human, but also something more"". After the credits, Manhattan is shown to be slowly recovering, the virus has been almost completely eradicated. Alex, standing on top of the Reuters Building in Times Square, comments that his work is almost done.",fort detrick special force unit dedicate woman elizabeth greene united marine corps game follow alexander genetic engineering company base possesses powerful shapeshifting ability penn station trigger karen lead alex alex faction ragland alex remove,prototype game user control alex mercer fight viral outbreak blacklight manhattan alex infect virus special mutant ability evolve time aid virus game follow alexander mercer voice barry pepper wake morgue basement gentek genetic engineering company base manhattan send pair scientist perform autopsy alex escape witness scientist gun military operative alex discover attack survive bullet chest leap wall safety discover possess powerful shapeshifting ability superhuman strength speed agility durability sense endurance weaponry ability consume people gain memory skill appearance memory previous life alex decides consume relate conspiracy uncover truth quest alex faction united marine corp blackwatch fort detrick special force unit dedicate combat biological warfare infected monster create virus blacklight overrun manhattan captain robert cross voice jeffrey pierce blackwatch officer alex alex contact sister dana voice lake bell assist track target lead infiltration gentek headquarters woman elizabeth greene building greene host blacklight escape unleash manhattan dana direct alex karen parker exgirlfriend agree aid virus require alex bring sample virus karen lead alex trap confront cross battle alex defeat cross cross mention penn station trigger flashback leave alex daze alex inject parasite threaten kill alex seek dr ragland pathologist link gentek ragland alex remove parasite weapon greene greene body reject parasite rejected biomass form monstrous supreme hunter alex kill origin virus elizabeth greene uncover contact government virus predecessor hope idaho design target predetermined race virus mutate deadly population infect elizabeth greene sole survivor anomaly body biology accept virus rewrite genetic code unborn son codenamed pariah remain population hope idaho liquidate blackwatch greene pariah captivity alex discover blackwatch shut gentek project leak project personnel eliminate alex mercer sample blacklight insurance eventually pin blackwatch penn station alex final desperation vengeance shatters vial blacklight release virus gun virus enter mercer bloodstream bullet hole repair body cellular level contact alex pump bloodtox biological agent underground drive virus ground fight greene emerge encase towering monstrosity greene fall monster human form defeat consume alex memory apparent randall head blackwatch prepare destroy manhattan nuclear weapon contact reveal cross alex captain infiltrate uss ronald reagan randall alex consumes randall cross reveal supreme hunter assume cross identity consume attack alex assert blackwatch leave nyz search infect consume alex strong survive nuclear detonation alex defeat supreme hunter weapon atlantic ocean helicopter detonate catch blast remain float city regenerate consume crow credit reveal public military infection senator hear medium event manhattan nuclear biological terrorism promise retribution responsible alex reflect event occur truth uncover claim human credit manhattan slowly recover virus completely eradicated alex stand reuters building time square comment

Chains of Olympus serves as a prequel, unfolding its narrative a decade before the events in the original God of War. While retaining the familiar gameplay dynamics of its predecessors, subtle modifications enhance the overall experience. Kratos embarks on a journey through various levels, engaging in relentless combat against foes and formidable bosses, deciphering puzzles based on manipulating boxes, and participating in quick-time events. Throughout his odyssey, he amasses red orbs to fortify his weapons and abilities, secures Gorgon eyeballs to augment his health, and acquires Phoenix feathers to amplify his magical prowess.

The game's controls underwent refinement to harmonize with the reduced button configuration of the PSP. Dodging, for instance, now necessitates the utilization of both shoulder buttons and the analogue stick. The iconic Blades of Chaos, synonymous with the God of War series, make a return, accompanied by an array of new weapons and magical spells such as the Sun Shield, Efreet spell, and Light of Dawn.

The narrative unfolds as the Gods dispatch Kratos to the city of Attica, charging him with the defence against an encroaching Persian army. However, as Morpheus unleashes chaos, Kratos finds himself compelled to harness his formidable powers to once again rescue the world from impending doom. Set halfway through Kratos' ten years of servitude to the Gods, Chains of Olympus begins with Kratos being dispatched to the city of Attica to help defend it from the invading Persian army.

Controls are simple, with the game largely consisting of running, jumping and punching. Levels are made up of various types of blocks, such as collapsing blocks, sticky walls, bouncy volcanic rocks and deadly spikes, and also feature hazards such as water and deadly creatures. Almost all of the game's cut-scenes are done in a stick puppet style. The game begins with the narrator (played by Will Stamper) telling the adventures of the hundreds of friends aboard the S.S. Friendship, as well as Hatty Hattington, who is known as ""best friend to one and all"". After encountering a heavy storm, the S.S. Friendship becomes shipwrecked on a mysterious, seemingly abandoned island, and the crew itself vanishes. Upon waking up from the wreck, the player character seeks shelter from the storm in a dilapidated theater. Soon afterwards, the player discovers technologically advanced, highly-evolved cats restraining a captive Hatty as he is being fitted with an ominously glowing top hat. The hat appears to change him, and he alerts the cats to the player's presence, attacking them and rendering them unconscious.
Upon coming to, it is revealed that the entire crew of the S.S. Friendship is being held prisoner by the cats, with Hatty as their apparent new leader. The player is then released from their cell and forced into deadly games by the feline wardens. The cats, who force their prisoners into deadly theater performances, watch with amusement as the player fights for their survival. As the player completes challenges, they find gems which are spend on unlocking fellow crew members to play as in these theater performances. Appearing to be possessed by the hat's unknown powers, Hatty begins working for the cats and against the player.
As the player progresses, the narrator reveals more about the theater. Hundreds of years before the player shipwrecked on the island, Purrham Furbottom, a theatrical aficionado, sought to build the world's greatest theater. The opening night saw the most jaw-dropping feats and thrills the likes of which were never seen before, making the theater an overnight success. However, Furbottom did not allow intermissions in the theater, and after an untold amount of time watching the show, he died after ""pooping himself to death on the way to the bathroom."" Since then, his top hat has been passed down to various others, who were each revered by the cats as their leader, and who each met with grim fates of their own. The hat, the narrator theorizes, is haunted by the grief and sorrow of each of its past wearers, and Hatty is its current victim, having sunk into a depression while being surrounded by the many gems the player has accrued, without doing anything to help the state of the theater.
Eventually, the cats grow tired of Hatty's inaction, and begin rioting, striking, and more, while the player's challenges grow increasingly difficult. As the theater deteriorates further, the narrator provides encouragement to the player, and continues to shed light on the cats' mental state, which grows more unstable as time progresses. The narrator also instructs the player to enter The Vault, which houses Hatty and all the gems the player has spent, before the cats kill Hatty and the rest of the crew, starting the madness over again.
After completing the final set of challenges inside the Vault, the player breaks into Hatty's throne room. Hatty doesn't budge, so the player carries him out of the crumbling theater as the crew of the S.S. Friendship orchestrates a mass breakout. Everyone manages to make it back to the boat amidst the chaos, escaping the island and the cats that reside there. As the player celebrates with hot cocoa, he tries to cheer up Hatty, who the narrator implies has sunk into a catatonic state from prolonged exposure to the hat. The narrator sings a sad song as the credits roll, before quickly recovering and singing a more happy, upbeat song, rocking the boat and flinging Hatty into the sea, where he sinks to the bottom. The hat lands on his head and begins glowing green as opposed to its usual red, and shoots a beam skyward, where it sends the boat flying and continues into space, where it vaporizes a bear that appeared during the narrator's upbeat song. The narrator claims to understand what just happened, but does not explain, sending the game back to the title screen.",challenge grow increasingly difficult player discovers technologically advance player character seek shelter unlock fellow crew ominously glow hat,battleblock theater player control prisoner force play game devise hatty hattington control simple game consist jumping punching level type block collapse block sticky wall bouncy volcanic rock deadly spike feature hazard water deadly creature game cutscenes stick puppet style game narrator play stamper adventure friend aboard ss friendship hatty hattington friend encounter heavy storm friendship shipwreck mysterious seemingly abandon island crew vanish wake wreck player character seek shelter storm dilapidated theater player discover technologically advanced highlyevolved cat restrain captive hatty fit ominously glow hat hat change alert cat player presence attack render unconscious reveal entire crew friendship hold prisoner cat hatty apparent leader player release cell force deadly game feline wardens cat force prisoner deadly theater performance watch amusement player fight survival player complete challenge gem spend unlock fellow crew play theater performance possess hat unknown power hatty cat player player progress narrator reveal theater player shipwreck island purrham furbottom theatrical aficionado seek build theater night jawdropping feat thrill theater overnight success furbottom intermission theater untold time watch die pooping death bathroom hat pass revere cat leader meet grim fate hat narrator theorizes haunt grief sorrow wearer hatty current victim sink depression surround gems player accrue theater eventually cat grow tire hatty inaction riot strike player challenge grow increasingly difficult theater deteriorate narrator provide encouragement player continue light cat mental grow unstable time progress narrator instruct player enter vault house hatty gem player spend cat kill hatty rest crew start madness complete final set challenge vault player break hatty throne hatty budge player carry crumble theater crew friendship orchestrate mass breakout manage boat chaos escape island cat reside player celebrate hot cocoa cheer hatty narrator imply sink catatonic prolonged exposure hat narrator sing sad song credit roll recover sing happy upbeat song rock boat fling hatty sea sink hat land head glow green oppose usual red shoot beam skyward send boat fly continue space vaporize bear narrator upbeat song narrator claim understand happen explain send game title screen

The story shifts to an alternate reality where Alan Wake finds himself in a small Arizona town. Here, he faces off against his evil doppelgänger, Mr. Scratch, a murderous entity intent on destroying everything Alan holds dear.

The gameplay involves exploring the town, battling new and familiar supernatural enemies, and uncovering pieces of the narrative through manuscripts and other clues. The expansion introduces new weapons and combat mechanics while maintaining the series' focus on the use of light to combat darkness. The narrative explores themes of duality and reality, offering a more action-oriented experience compared to the original game. The plot of American Nightmare is framed by the narration of an episode of the fictional TV show, ""Night Springs,"" which follows the style of The Twilight Zone and appeared on television screens throughout the original Alan Wake.

Alan Wake's friend and manager, Barry, is asleep in a motel room. The narration explains that Alan is attempting to chase down the ""herald of darkness"", Mr. Scratch, who is Alan's evil doppelganger created by a dark force. Scratch is determined to take away everything Alan loves, including his wife, Alice. Alan, as the ""champion of light,"" has the ability to rewrite reality, and was able to write his escape from Cauldron Lake in Washington. He ends up near the small town of Night Springs, Arizona, and learns that he has been missing from the real world for nearly two years.

A nearby oil derrick erupts with several foes controlled by Mr. Scratch. Seeking light, Alan runs to a nearby motel, where he encounters Emma Sloan, who at first thinks he is Mr. Scratch, since they look identical. She tells Alan that Scratch was at the motel the night before, and provides Alan with a typewritten page, a way to alter reality to destroy the derrick and stop the foes. Alan follows its instructions, which causes a meteor to collide with an artificial satellite, sending it hurtling towards the ground, where it then collides with the oil derrick. While Alan is away performing this task, the dark forces consume Emma.

Following clues he found at the motel, along with a set of keys, Alan heads to a nearby observatory. There, Dr. Rachel Meadows, who also met Mr. Scratch previously, is tracking a mysterious signal sent just before the satellite was knocked out of orbit. Rachel tells Alan that Mr. Scratch was very interested in this signal, and Alan surmises that it must contain the key to fighting the darkness. While attempting to obtain the complete signal, the observatory's telescope is sabotaged by the darkness, which reinforces Alan's belief that the signal contains something he needs. After repairing the damage, a portion of the signal comes through that translates into a page of a story: a new reality that Alan can presumably implement.

The page points him to a nearby drive-in theater, where he meets Serena Valdivia, who is under the influence of the darkness. After freeing her by restoring power and switching the lights on, Serena tells Alan that Mr. Scratch is trying to prevent the sun from ever rising again. She gives Alan the security code to the projection room where he can change reality. Alan uses the incomplete message to try to set the new reality. However, as the message is only partial, the new reality does not take effect. Mr. Scratch appears, gloating, and sends Alan back in time to a few hours before.
Waking up again near the motel, Alan repeats many of the same motions. Emma and Rachel still have some deja vu of the previous loop's events, and have helped perform some of Alan's previous tasks for him. Despite his efforts to change events this time around, Emma is nevertheless consumed again by the darkness. Rachel is able to capture a longer portion of the signal this time, but it is still incomplete. When Alan returns to the drive-in theater, he is again unable to complete the new reality and is sent back in time again by Mr. Scratch.

Alan repeats his actions for a third time, but this time, he is able to save Emma and gain the complete message from Rachel. He sets the correct series of events in the projection room, which triggers the projector to show a film made by Alice. Mr. Scratch appears again, but discovers that Alan has successfully written the new reality, and he is burned out of existence by the film. On the screen, Alan appears to reunite with Alice along a sun-lit shoreline; however, the narrator notes that this could quite possibly be just a figment of Alan's imagination, since he is still trapped in the Dark Place.

During the credits, it is revealed that the name of the episode of Night Springs that Alan wrote himself into was titled ""Return"", a reference to the manuscript he began to type at the end of Special Two: The Writer.

You can play as either Sonic or Blaze as you try to track down powerful Sol emeralds. Sonic Rush displays the level over both screens, allowing for screen-spanning jumps and dives. Some gameplay modes include stylus support as well.

Designed as a 2.5D side-scroller, Sonic Rush is the first game in the Sonic series to explore both 2D and 3D venues by combining two-dimensional environments with three-dimensional models. In 2007, the game received a sequel, Sonic Rush Adventure. At the beginning of the story, Blaze the Cat, an antisocial princess from an alternate dimension, appears on Sonic's world. Her world had the seven Sol Emeralds—gems similar to the Chaos Emeralds—which it relies on for survival. However, they were stolen by Dr. Eggman and as Blaze was chasing him, a light brought her to this world. Blaze then makes it her goal to personally retrieve the Emeralds from Eggman. Upon finding Eggman, the doctor flaunts a Sol Emerald, stating that he needs them to access ultimate power. Enraged, Blaze defeats Eggman and regains the Emerald. Though Eggman escapes, Blaze is determined to get the rest.

Confused and alone, Blaze ponders how she will get the Sol Emeralds back, and how to return home. She soon spots Cream the Rabbit and Cheese hiding in the bushes, and is surprised by Cream's politeness, the young rabbit eager to make friends with Blaze. Brought to Cream's home for a cup of tea, Vanilla and Cream convince Blaze to have the latter be her local guide after hearing her story. However, Blaze dismisses their advice to seek Sonic's aid, believing she can do this alone. Despite having Cream tag along, Blaze remains mostly indifferent to the young rabbit's efforts to be her friend.

Elsewhere, Sonic encounters Eggman during a run, who boasts about how he will soon have ultimate power. Upon defeating Eggman, Sonic finds a Sol Emerald that Eggman dropped, at which point Blaze appears and reclaims it, thanking Sonic for defeating Eggman before leaving.

Drift cars require players to tap the brake once while turning to break into a smooth powerslide while Grip cars requires players to alternate between brakes and gas while turning to powerslide.
Vehicles are earned by playing through the game's Grand Prix mode. Players select one of four teams; R.C Micro Mouse Mappy, Pac Racing Club, Racing Team Solvalou and Dig Racing Team, who each have varying difficulties, and one of four manufacturers; Age Solo, Lizard, Assoluto and Terrazi, which determines the style of car and powerslide type the player will use. In each race, the player must attempt to reach a qualifying position, with later stages requiring players to place in higher positions to qualify. Depending on the qualifying position in each race, players will be awarded a new vehicle, or an upgrade to their current one, based on their team and manufacturer, with better cars earned for reaching consistently higher positions (i.e. the best cars are earned by placing 1st in each match while the least impressive cars are earned by just clearing the minimum qualifying positions). There are a total of 320 vehicles earned by racing with every combination of team, manufacturer and qualifying position. If the players unlock all 320 cars, they will unlock an additional one modelled after Pac-Man, for a total of 321 vehicles.
The game also features Time Attack mode, in which players can attempt to get the fastest time on each course, and VS. Battle, a split-screen mode for two players (the first to appear in the home console series) and an undocumented PlayStation Link Cable mode, allowing four players to play simultaneously. Players can also create them our car decors and participate in Extra Trials against powerful prototype cars. The game is also compatible with the JogCon peripheral and the PocketStation device, which allows players to trade cars with friends.
A further new feature was the Decal Edit, which allowed players to design their own logo for use on cars.",game feature time attack mode feature drive model undocumented playstation link cable mode micro mouse mappy ridge racer type ridge racer type stag require player reach consistently position minimum qualify position ridge racer game player split screen mode,ridge racer type fourth game ridge racer series track reverse variant total layout vehicle fictional iteration game playstation feature gouraud shade polygon game visual depth ridge racer game sony feature twoplayer split screen mode feature drive model ridge racer type arcadestyle racing game strong emphasis powersliding corner vehicle style powersliding depend car select drift grip drift car require player tap brake break smooth powerslide grip car require player alternate brake gas powerslide vehicle earn play game grand prix mode player select team rc micro mouse mappy pac race club race team solvalou dig racing team vary difficulty manufacturer age solo lizard assoluto terrazi determine style car powerslide type player race player attempt reach qualifying position late stage require player position qualify depend qualify position race player award vehicle upgrade current base team manufacturer car earn reach consistently position car earn match impressive car earn minimum qualifying position total vehicle earn race combination team manufacturer qualify position player unlock car unlock additional model pacman total vehicle game feature time attack mode player attempt fast time battle splitscreen mode player console series undocumented playstation link cable mode player play simultaneously player create car decor participate extra trial powerful prototype car game compatible jogcon peripheral pocketstation device player trade car friend feature decal edit player design logo car

Ported by Bluepoint Games, the collection was released exclusively for the PlayStation 4 on October 7, 2015 in Europe and October 9th, 2015 in North America.

The Nathan Drake Collection features the original three games in the Uncharted series with 1080p resolution, 60 frames per second, better lighting, textures and models. The collection also implements a ""Photo Mode"", a mode where the player can freeze the game at any moment to take personalized screenshots, derived from Naughty Dog's other remastered entry, The Last of Us Remastered, as well as new trophies. The ported games only include their respective single-player modes.

The pre-ordered version of The Nathan Drake Collection includes the ""Nathan Drake Pack"", which consists of single-player skins of iconic Nathan Drake outfits, as well as two weapons: the Golden AK-47 and Golden 92FS - 9mm. Pre-ordering the collection as a digital download through the PlayStation Store would also give an exclusive Uncharted: The Nathan Drake Collection PlayStation 4 dynamic theme.

Purchasing The Nathan Drake Collection, and owning a valid subscription to PlayStation Plus, before the expiry date of December 13, 2015 would grant the player exclusive access to the multiplayer beta of A Thief's End. Uncharted:
Treasure hunter Nathan ""Nate"" Drake (Nolan North), accompanied by reporter Elena Fisher (Emily Rose), recovers the coffin of his self-proclaimed ancestor Sir Francis Drake, having located it from coordinates inscribed on a family heirloom: a ring Nate wears around his neck. The coffin contains Sir Francis Drake's diary, which gives the location of El Dorado. Pirates attack and destroy Nate's boat, but Nate's friend and mentor Victor ""Sully"" Sullivan (Richard McGonagle) rescues the two in his seaplane. Fearing Elena's reporting will attract potential rivals, Nate and Sully abandon her at a dock.

Following the diary to the indicated spot, Nate and Sully discover an alcove that once held a large statue, and realize that El Dorado is not a city but rather a golden idol. They find a Nazi U-boat, which contains a page from Drake's diary showing the statue was taken to an island. However, mercenaries led by criminal Gabriel Roman (Simon Templeman) and his lieutenant Atoq Navarro (Robin Atkin Downes) intercept Nate and Sully. Sully is seemingly killed by a shot to the chest, but Nate manages to escape, encounters Elena, and flies with her to the island.

On the way, anti-aircraft fire forces Elena and Nate to bail out and they are separated. After retrieving supplies from the wrecked seaplane, Nate heads toward an old fort to find Elena. Briefly captured by pirates led by old associate Eddy Raja (James Sie), Elena breaks Nate free and they flee to the island's old customs house. After finding records showing the statue was moved further inland, they find that Sully is alive and accompanying Roman and Raja. Nate and Elena find and rescue Sully who, having survived due to Drake's diary blocking the bullet, explains he was buying time for Nate by giving Roman misinformation.

Uncharted 2:
Two years after the events of the first game, treasure hunter Nathan Drake (Nolan North) is approached by former associate Harry Flynn (Steve Valentine) and Flynn's girlfriend Chloe Frazer (Claudia Black) to help steal a Mongolian oil lamp connected to Marco Polo's doomed 1292 voyage from China. The group plans to cheat Flynn's client and take Polo's treasure for themselves. Unbeknownst to Flynn, Chloe and Nate had worked together before, and Chloe plans on blackmailing Flynn and escaping with Nate and whatever treasure they find.

Nate and Flynn break into a museum in Istanbul and find the lamp, which contains a map and flammable resin that reveals Polo's fleet was shipwrecked in Borneo, and was carrying the Cintamani Stone from the fabled city of Shambhala. Flynn double-crosses Nate, leaving him to be arrested.

Three months later, Chloe helps free Nate with his longtime friend Victor Sullivan (Richard McGonagle). She reveals that Flynn is working for Zoran Lazarević (Graham McTavish), a Serbian war criminal seeking the stone. In Borneo, Nate and Sully infiltrate Lazarević's camp, with Chloe as a mole. Nate discovers that the stone never left Shambhala, and locates a temple containing the bodies of Polo's crew, as well as a phurba and map detailing that its carrier will gain passage to Shambhala through a temple in Nepal. Nate and Sully escape after being cornered by Flynn and his men.

Uncharted 3:
The story begins with Nathan ""Nate"" Drake (Nolan North) and Victor ""Sully"" Sullivan (Richard McGonagle) entering a pub in London to meet with a man named Talbot (Robin Atkin Downes), who is interested in purchasing Nate's ring. During the meeting, Nate and Sully accuse Talbot of offering them counterfeit banknotes, and a fight ensues. After fighting their way past Talbot's thugs, Nate and Sully emerge in an alleyway, where they are surrounded and subdued by Charlie Cutter (Graham McTavish), Talbot's cohort. They are then approached by Talbot's client, Katherine Marlowe (Rosalind Ayres), who steals Drake's ring. Nate attempts to go after her, but Cutter guns him and Sully down, seemingly killing them.

The story flashes back to 20 years earlier, where a teenage Nathan Drake (Billy Unger) explores a museum in Cartagena, Colombia, in search of Sir Francis Drake's ring, but is thrown out after guards suspect him of being a thief. Intrigued by the actions of Victor Sullivan, who he does not know at this point, Nate follows Sully to a keymaker and pickpockets him, before returning to the museum. He steals the ring, but before he can leave he is caught by Marlowe, her henchmen, and Sully, who was working for her. Nate flees with the ring, with Marlowe's agents in pursuit, but Sully rescues Nate from the agents and decides to act as a mentor to him.",james sie elena break nate nathan drake collection playstation dynamic theme adventure shooter platform video game drake playstation store proclaimed ancestor sir francis drake coffin sir francis drake emily rise recovers frame serbian war criminal seek aircraft force elena iconic nathan drake outfit robin atkin downes mongolian oil lamp connect nathan drake pack nathan drake collection include nathan drake collection feature graham mctavish talbot associate harry flynn chloe nate associate eddy raja nolan north accompanied treasure hunter nathan drake stone leave shambhala,uncharted nathan drake collection remastered compilation actionadventure shooter platform video game drake fortune thief drake deception port bluepoint game collection release exclusively playstation october europe october north america nathan drake collection feature original game uncharted series resolution frame lighting texture model collection implement photo mode mode player freeze game moment personalized screenshots derive naughty dog remastered entry remastered trophy port game include respective singleplayer modes preordered version nathan drake collection include nathan drake pack consist singleplayer skin iconic nathan drake outfit weapon golden ak golden preordering collection digital download playstation store exclusive uncharted nathan drake collection playstation dynamic theme purchase nathan drake collection valid subscription playstation expiry december grant player exclusive access multiplayer beta thief uncharted treasure hunter nathan nate drake nolan north accompany reporter elena fisher emily rise recovers coffin selfproclaimed ancestor sir francis drake locate coordinate inscribe family heirloom nate wear neck coffin sir francis drake diary location el dorado pirate attack destroy nate boat nate friend mentor victor sully sullivan richard mcgonagle rescue seaplane fear elena report attract potential rival nate sully abandon dock follow diary spot nate sully discover alcove hold statue realize el dorado city golden idol nazi uboat drake diary statue island mercenary lead criminal gabriel roman simon templeman lieutenant atoq navarro robin atkin downes intercept nate sully sully seemingly kill shot chest nate manages escape encounter elena fly island antiaircraft force elena nate bail separate retrieve supply wrecked seaplane nate head fort elena capture pirate lead associate eddy raja james sie elena break nate flee island custom house record statue inland sully alive accompany roman raja nate elena rescue sully survive drake diary block bullet explain time nate roman misinformation uncharted event game treasure hunter nathan drake nolan north approach associate harry flynn steve valentine flynn girlfriend chloe frazer claudia black steal mongolian oil lamp connect marco polo doom voyage china plan cheat flynn client polo treasure unbeknownst flynn chloe nate chloe plan blackmail flynn escape nate treasure nate flynn break museum istanbul lamp map flammable resin reveals polo fleet shipwreck borneo carry cintamani stone fabled city shambhala flynn doublecrosses nate leave arrest month chloe nate longtime friend victor sullivan richard mcgonagle reveal flynn zoran lazarevic graham mctavish serbian war criminal seek stone borneo nate sully infiltrate lazarevic camp chloe mole nate discovers stone leave shambhala locate temple body polo crew phurba map carrier gain passage shambhala temple nepal nate sully escape corner flynn uncharted story nathan nate drake nolan north victor sully sullivan richard mcgonagle enter pub london meet talbot robin atkin downes purchase nate meeting nate sully accuse talbot offer counterfeit banknote fight ensues fight talbot thugs nate sully emerge alleyway surround subdue charlie cutter graham mctavish talbot cohort approach talbot client katherine marlowe rosalind ayres steal drake nate attempt cutter gun sully seemingly kill story flash earlier teenage nathan drake billy unger explore museum cartagena colombia search sir francis drake throw guard suspect thief intrigue action victor sullivan nate follow sully keymaker pickpocket return museum steal leave catch marlowe henchman sully nate flees marlowe agent pursuit sully rescue nate agent decides mentor

Despite ascending to the title of the god of war, Kratos remains haunted by nightmarish visions. One such vision compels him to embark on a new journey when he witnesses his mother, Callisto, imprisoned in Atlantis under the dominion of the sea god Poseidon. Against Athena's counsel to ignore the vision, Kratos sets forth to unravel his past and, in the process, rescue his long-lost brother, Deimos, from the clutches of the god of death, Thanatos.

This second instalment for the PlayStation Portable (PSP) maintains a gameplay style akin to its predecessor, introducing a handful of new mechanics. Kratos wields his trusty Blades of Athena in this quest, now augmented with a new magic known as Thera's Bane, amplifying the potency of his attacks. The game also introduces several new magical items and a fresh secondary weapon. In addition to the captivating story mode, Ghost of Sparta offers the ""Temple of Zeus,"" a location where players can spend orbs acquired in the Battle Arena to acquire various art and other bonuses."" The Oracle foretold that the demise of Olympus would come not from the Titans; but by a Marked Warrior, a mortal. The Olympian Gods Zeus and Ares believed this warrior to be Deimos, brother of Kratos, due to his strange birthmarks. Ares sieges a village of Sparta and interrupts the childhood training of Kratos and Deimos, with Athena on hand to watch over him, and kidnaps Deimos. Kratos attempts to stop Ares but is swept aside and scarred across his right eye by the violent Olympian. Ares prepares to kill the young Kratos for attacking him. Athena stops Ares and tells him they only came for the Marked Warrior, not to take the boy's life. Taken to the Domain of Death, Deimos is imprisoned and tortured by the God of Death, Thanatos.",game introduce magical item,mark kratos foray portable game god war ghost sparta stand spinoff nestle event god war god war ascend title god war kratos remain haunt nightmarish vision vision compels embark journey witness mother callisto imprison atlantis dominion sea god poseidon athena counsel ignore vision kratos set unravel process rescue longlost brother deimos clutch god death thanatos instalment playstation portable psp maintain gameplay style akin predecessor introduce handful mechanic kratos wield trusty blade athena quest augment magic thera bane amplify potency attack game introduce magical item fresh secondary weapon addition captivate story mode ghost sparta offer temple zeus location player spend orbs acquire battle arena acquire art bonus oracle foretell demise olympus titan marked warrior mortal olympian god zeus ares warrior deimos brother kratos strange birthmark ares sieges village sparta interrupt childhood training kratos deimos athena hand watch kidnap deimos kratos attempt swept scar eye violent olympian prepare kill kratos attack athena marked warrior boy life domain death deimos imprison torture god death thanatos

(Playable Teaser) is a first-person interactive teaser directed by Hideo Kojima and developed by Kojima Productions under the alias of ""7780s Studios"". It is a psychological survival horror that combined simplicity with an anxiety-inducing environment. The player must investigate the gruesome backstory surrounding the house, and solve puzzles to get to the end game where a cut scene will initiate, and reveal the official teaser trailer for Silent Hills. P.T is widely accepted as a game in its own right, as not only is it considered deeply engaging, but also enjoys significant replay value thanks to its cryptic nature. Due to the cancellation on Silent Hills, it is no longer available for download. P.T. centers on an unnamed protagonist who awakens in a concrete-lined room, and opens a door to a haunted corridor, in which he can only walk through a hallway which continuously loops and redecorates itself. On the radio, news broadcast details on how two families were slaughtered by their respective fathers. Much of the plot of P.T. is told through connecting-the-dots and radio broadcasts. However, some aspects of the plot are left to player interpretation and speculation. Later on, paranormal activity begins to occur, which includes the appearance of a manifestation of the mother from a murdered family, the corridor becoming endless and the lights glowing red. Mysterious broadcasts also emerge from the radio. After the protagonist solves the final puzzle, a cutscene shows him in Silent Hill, presumably unaware of where he is.

In addition to new abilities and subgames, Kirby & the Amazing Mirror also introduces new multiplayer modes. There is a Mirror World that exists in the skies of Dream Land where any wish reflected in the mirror will come true. However, one day it copies the mind of a mysterious figure and creates a reflected world of evil. Meta Knight notices this and flies up to save the Mirror World.

Meanwhile, Kirby is taking a walk when Dark Meta Knight appears. Before Kirby can react, Dark Meta Knight slices Kirby in four and Kirby becomes four different colored Kirbys. They chase after Dark Meta Knight on a Warp Star simultaneously and enter the Mirror World.

It is revealed that the two Meta Knights fought each other until the real Meta Knight was defeated. He was then knocked into the mirror, which was in turn cut into eight fragments by Dark Meta Knight and scattered across the Mirror World, prompting the Kirbys to save Meta Knight and the Mirror World. After collecting all eight mirror fragments, Kirby enters the Mirror World and battles Dark Meta Knight. After defeating him, a vortex appears and sucks Kirby in, who is given Meta Knight's sword. Kirby then proceeds to fight Dark Mind, the true mastermind behind the Mirror World's corruption, multiple times. Upon defeat, the Mirror World is saved, and Shadow Kirby (the Mirror World counterpart of Kirby who is believed to be an enemy, but is now an ally) waves his goodbyes to the four Kirbys as they all exit the Mirror World one by one.

The player character, Adrian Shephard, is sent in to neutralize the Black Mesa Research Facility after a scientific mishap causes it to be invaded by aliens, but quickly finds that the Marines are outnumbered and slowly being beaten back by a second alien race and black operations units. Opposing Force opens with Shephard riding on a V-22 Osprey with his squad. His squad discuss their deployment, somewhat irritated that they have not been told what they are being deployed for. However, as they are nearing their Landing Zone at Black Mesa, airborne alien creatures attack the Osprey formation, causing Shephard's Osprey to crash land. Shephard regains consciousness in a Black Mesa medical bay, tended to by the science team, learning that the Marines are being steadily beaten by the alien forces from Xen and orders have come through to pull out. Consequently, Shephard departs to reach an extraction point and escape the facility. However, Shephard is prevented from reaching the extraction point by the enigmatic G-Man, forcing the evacuation craft to leave without him.

Other Marines who have also been left behind team up with Shephard and attempt to reach another extraction point near Black Mesa's Lambda Complex, but en route they come under attack from black operations units seeking to thoroughly contain the situation and eliminate all survivors. Shephard makes it to the Lambda Complex alive, and briefly sees Gordon Freeman as the latter teleports to Xen in the final stages of Half-Life. To escape the teleportation chamber, Shephard is forced to enter a separate portal, briefly taking him to Xen before depositing him in an entirely different area of the facility. The facility is now heavily damaged, and it soon becomes clear that a new alien race, Race X, has exploited the situation to mount a localized invasion, attacking both human and Xen forces in Black Mesa indiscriminately. Fighting between the black operations units and Race X quickly intensifies.

Shephard soon encounters more stranded Marine units in the wreckage of the base, and tries to break through the black operations units to reach an escape point past the facility's storage unit, but meets heavy resistance from both Race X and the black operations units. A surviving Black Mesa security guard reveals to Shephard that the black operators intend to detonate a tactical nuclear weapon in the base, thereby totally sealing it off and killing everything in it. After successfully neutralizing the guarding black operations unit, Shephard disarms the device and proceeds to the nearby storage areas, intent on escape. However, the G-Man rearms the device as Shephard departs. The storage unit has become a thick battleground between Race X and the black operation units, and although Shephard manages to evade them, he is informed by another security guard that something very large is coming through an alien portal blocking the exit path.

At the portal, Shephard discovers a gene worm, a massive creature facilitating the Race X invasion. Shephard is able to kill the creature, but just afterwards he is teleported onto an Osprey by the G-Man. As the G-Man congratulates Shephard on his accomplishments, the nuclear device detonates in the background, destroying Black Mesa. The game closes with the G-Man detaining Shephard someplace where he can tell no one of what he has seen and cannot be harmed, pending further evaluation.",reach extraction black mesa survive black mesa security guard reveal black mesa medical bay gordon freeman black operation unit seek security guard guard black operation unit airborne alien creature attack black mesa facility race intensify detain shephard someplace,oppose force return setting halflife portray event perspective marine enemy character original game player character adrian shephard send neutralize black mesa facility scientific mishap invade alien marine outnumber slowly beat alien race black operation unit oppose force shephard rid osprey squad squad discuss deployment irritate deploy landing zone black mesa airborne alien creature attack osprey formation shephard osprey crash land shephard regain consciousness black mesa medical bay tend science team learning marine steadily beat alien force xen pull shephard depart reach extraction escape facility shephard prevent reach extraction enigmatic gman force evacuation craft leave marine leave team shephard attempt reach extraction black mesa lambda complex en route attack black operation unit seek situation eliminate survivor shephard lambda complex alive gordon freeman teleports xen final stage halflife escape teleportation chamber shephard force enter separate portal xen deposit facility facility heavily damage alien race race exploit situation mount localized invasion attack human xen force black mesa indiscriminately fight black operation unit race intensify shephard encounter stranded marine unit wreckage base break black operation unit reach escape facility storage unit meet heavy resistance race black operation unit survive black mesa security guard reveals shephard black operator intend detonate tactical nuclear weapon base totally seal kill neutralize guarding black operation unit shephard disarm device proceeds nearby storage intent escape gman rearm device shephard depart storage unit battleground race black operation unit shephard manages evade inform security guard alien portal block exit path portal shephard discover gene worm massive creature facilitate race invasion shephard kill creature teleport osprey gman gman congratulate shephard accomplishment nuclear device detonates background destroy black mesa game close gman detain shephard someplace harm pending evaluation

Fatal Frame was the first to introduce the innovative use of an old-style camera as the primary weapon. In addition to navigating the main characters around the mansion grounds, players are able to enter Viewfinder Mode, where the camera is raised and the view changes to that of the camera's frame. In viewfinder mode the player is able to snap photographs of ghosts, both violent and benign, which is the main method of progressing through the game. Items are also available, some being consumable and most being key items needed to unlock doors, complete tasks or solve puzzles. Puzzles are encountered frequently in the game, some being based on the same concept but becoming progressively more difficult. The varying difficulty settings of the game (Easy, Normal, Hard, Nightmare, or Fatal (Xbox only)) determine the amount of consumable items scattered throughout the mansion and how formidable the enemies are.

The main horror aspect of the game is, undoubtedly, the ghosts. The mechanics programmed for the ghosts allow them to float ethereally through the air, walls and floors, and even teleport, allowing them many ways to attack the player. The ghosts' appearances are usually inspired by their deaths or by Japanese stigmas of horror, which, some argue, are particularily chilling.

The game, depending on which console it is played on, offers two endings. Upon completion of the game, a ranking is given based on total time taken, points accumulated and other categories. The player is also given rewards and unlockables, such as alternate costumes and camera functions, depending on what difficulty was beaten, how much of the Ghost List was completed and other criteria. Beating the game also unlocks Battle Mode, where the player is faced with fighting specific ghosts, and is rewarded with points towards purchasing unlockables. An option is also given where the game can be replayed with all equipment, upgrades and unlockables carried over. As the girls explore the western-style mansions and abandoned hospitals on Rougetsu Isle, they will rely on the moonlight and a faint flashlight to search for clues. The story progresses by discovering relics like old newspaper articles and notes that help the girls unravel the island’s secret past. While exploring, the girls will also be confronted by a series of spirits. They will need to use a Fatal Frame franchise classic, the Camera Obscura, to repel vengeful ghosts, sealing away their power by photographing them. Throughout the game, the girls will need to equip stronger lenses and change out different films in order to capture the most powerful spirits, while also using the camera to capture “things that cannot be seen” to help them find the evidence they need to remember their haunting past.",discover relic newspaper article game unlock battle mode purchasing unlockables,fatal frame game fatal frame series introduce franchise unique premise fight ghost special camera fatal frame introduce innovative oldstyle camera primary weapon addition navigate main character mansion ground player enter viewfinder mode camera raise view change camera frame viewfinder mode player snap photograph ghost violent benign main method progress game item consumable key item unlock door complete task solve puzzle puzzle encounter frequently game base concept progressively difficult vary difficulty setting game easy normal hard nightmare fatal xbox determine consumable item scatter mansion formidable enemy main horror aspect game undoubtedly ghost mechanic program ghost float ethereally air wall floor teleport attack player ghost appearance inspire death japanese stigma horror argue particularily chill game depend console play offer completion game ranking base total time accumulate category player reward unlockables alternate costume camera function depend difficulty beat ghost list complete criterion beat game unlock battle mode player fight specific ghost reward purchase unlockables option game replay equipment upgrade unlockables carry girl explore westernstyle mansion abandon hospital rougetsu isle rely moonlight faint flashlight search clue story progress discover relic newspaper article note girl unravel island secret explore girl confront series spirit fatal frame franchise classic camera obscura repel vengeful ghost seal power photograph game girl equip strong lens change film capture powerful spirit camera capture evidence remember haunting

The game uses a cel-shaded style of animation, and has been widely acclaimed for its unique music style, detailed art, and gameplay.

Jet Set Radio Future is set in Tokyo-To, Japan, in 2024, where a street gang known as the GG's is fighting for control over the streets against rival gangs, as well as the big and powerful corporation known as the Rokkaku Group, led by Gouji Rokkaku. The Rokkaku Group is attempting to sieze control of Tokyo by force and convert it to a totalitarian police state.

The game revolves around a special forces operative codenamed Solid Snake who goes into a solo infiltration mission into the fortified state of Outer Heaven to destroy Metal Gear, a bipedal walking tank capable of launching nuclear missiles from anywhere in the world.

The player must navigate the main character, a military operative codenamed Solid Snake, through various locations, while avoiding visual contact and direct confrontation with patrolling guards. If the player is seen, the game enters the ""Alert Mode."" In this situation, Snake must escape from enemy's sight in order to resume infiltration. The method of escaping varies depending on the circumstances behind discovery:

If Snake is seen and only a single exclamation mark appears over an enemy's head, only the enemies in the player's present screen will attack and Snake can escape by simply moving to an adjacent screen.
However, if two exclamation marks appear over the enemy (or the player triggers an alarm by being spotted by a camera, infrared sensor or by using an unsuppressed weapon), reinforcements from off-screen will appear as well. Snake can only escape by eliminating all incoming enemies, going outdoors, or by entering an elevator.
The player starts the game unarmed, but eventually acquires firearms such as a Beretta 92F and an M79 grenade launcher, as well as explosives such as remote control missiles and landmines. Ammo and supplies for weapons are limited, but are replenished by picking up ammunition caches or additional supplies. Weapons can not only be used to kill enemies, but also to clear obstacles such as hollow walls and electrified floors. Snake can also use his fists to punch and defeat patrolling enemies. Occasionally, if the player defeats a guard with punches without alerting anyone, the defeated guard will yield a single unit of rations or an ammo box that can be picked up. In addition to enemy guards, the player will also be confronted by mercenaries who will challenge the player to combat, serving as the boss characters.

The enemy base consists of three different buildings, with multiple floors (including basement levels) within them. The player uses key cards and other items to unlock doors and explore new areas. Each door will only open to its corresponding key cards. Information can be obtained by rescuing hostages being held within the buildings. After rescuing five hostages, the player's rank will increase by one star (with the maximum rank being four stars), allowing for increased carrying capacity and maximum health. However, if a hostage is killed, the player is demoted to the previous rank.

A transceiver is available for the player to communicate with their commanding officer, Big Boss, or one of the resistance members operating covertly near Outer Heaven (Schneider, Diane, and Jennifer). Each of Snake's allies specializes in a specific subject. The player must keep track of their allies' frequency numbers in order to contact them. All of the radio messages are dependent on the rooms where the player is located.",resistance operate covertly outer heaven special force operative codenamed solid snake military operative codenamed solid snake unsuppressed weapon reinforcement punch alert star bipedal walk tank capable single exclamation mark video game design exclamation mark metal gear sequel player track player key card,metal gear progenitor stealth game genre video game design hideo kojima direct late metal gear sequels game revolve special force operative codenamed solid snake solo infiltration mission fortified outer heaven destroy metal gear bipedal walking tank capable launch nuclear missile player navigate main character military operative codenamed solid snake location avoid visual contact direct confrontation patrolling guard player game enter alert mode situation snake escape enemy sight resume infiltration method escape varies depend circumstance discovery snake single exclamation mark enemy head enemy player screen attack snake escape simply adjacent screen exclamation mark enemy player trigger alarm spot camera infrared sensor unsuppressed weapon reinforcement offscreen snake escape eliminate incoming enemy outdoors enter elevator player start game unarm eventually acquire firearm beretta grenade launcher explosive remote control missile landmines ammo supply weapon limit replenish pick ammunition cache additional supply weapon kill enemy obstacle hollow wall electrified floor snake fist punch defeat patrol enemy occasionally player defeat guard punch alert defeat guard yield single unit ration ammo box pick addition enemy guard player confront mercenary challenge player combat serve bos character enemy base consist building multiple floor include basement level player key card item unlock door explore door correspond key card rescue hostage hold building rescue hostage player rank increase star maximum rank star increase carrying capacity maximum health hostage kill player demote previous rank transceiver player communicate commanding officer bos resistance operate covertly outer heaven schneider diane jennifer snake ally specialize specific subject player track ally frequency contact radio message dependent player locate

From a house in the city, journey to a series of worlds and solve puzzles to rescue an abducted princess. In each world, you have a different power to affect the way time behaves, and it is time's strangeness that creates the puzzles. The time behaviors include: the ability to rewind, objects that are immune to being rewound, time that is tied to space, parallel realities, time dilation, and perhaps more.

Braid treats your time and attention as precious; there is no filler in this game. Every puzzle shows you something new and interesting about the game world. Tim is a man searching for a princess who ""has been snatched by a horrible and evil monster.""His relationship with this princess is vague at best, and the only clear part of this relationship is that Tim has made some sort of mistake which he hopes to reconcile or, if possible, erase. As one progresses through the six worlds in Braid, storyline text at the beginning of each world provides further insight into Tim's quest for the princess, and alludes to the overarching gameplay mechanic of each level. The themes evoked include forgiveness, desire, and frustration. The final level, in which everything but Tim moves in reverse, depicts the princess escaping from a knight, and working together with Tim to surpass obstacles and meet at her home. Tim is suddenly locked out of the house, and, as time progresses forward, reversing Tim's actions, the events show the princess running from Tim, setting traps that he is able to evade, until she is rescued by the knight. Tim is revealed to be the ""monster"" the princess is running from.
Following completion of the game, the player finds additional texts that expand the story. The ending of the game is purposely ambiguous, and has been subject to multiple interpretations. One theory, based on the inclusion of a hidden event and the famous quotation stated by Kenneth Bainbridge after the detonation of the first atomic bomb—""Now we are all sons of bitches""—is that the princess represents the atomic bomb and Tim is a scientist involved in its development.[20] Some also refer to the name of the game as both reference to the hair braid of the princess Tim seeks as well as the intertwining of time, demonstrated by the various time mechanics explored in the game. Journalists have considered Braid's plot to be interwoven with the game itself, much as the book Dictionary of the Khazars and the films Memento and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind interweave the narrative into the work's construction. In this sense, some have considered the game to carry a simple credo, such as ""You must look back to go forwards"" as suggested by Eurogamer's Dan Whitehead. Others have likened Braid to punk rock, designed (as explicitly stated by Blow) specifically as a statement against the status quo of the industry; it is considered to deconstruct traditional gameplay concepts, such as jumping on enemies or rescuing a princess from a castle as borrowed from Super Mario Bros., and rebuild them in the game to force the player to rethink current game design. Blow has stated that there is more than one interpretation of the story; he ""would not be capable"" of explaining the whole story of the game in words, and said that the central idea is ""something big and subtle and resists being looked at directly.""Blow considered Braid to be ""about the journey, not the destination"". He deliberately designed the plot not to be fully revealed to the player unless they completed the game, seeing it as a way to provide ""a longer-term challenge"".",super mario bros theme evoke include forgiveness deconstruct traditional gameplay concept player additional time mechanic explore atomic bomb rethink current game design,braid puzzleplatformer drawn painterly style manipulate flow time strange unusual house city journey series solve puzzle rescue abducted princess power affect time behaves time strangeness create puzzle time behavior include ability rewind object immune rewound time tie space parallel reality time dilation braid treat time attention precious filler game puzzle game tim search princess snatch horrible evil monsterhis relationship princess vague relationship tim sort mistake hop reconcile erase progress braid storyline provide insight tim quest princess alludes overarch gameplay mechanic level theme evoke include forgiveness desire frustration final level tim reverse depict princess escape knight tim surpass obstacle meet tim suddenly lock house time progress reverse tim action event princess tim set trap evade rescue knight tim reveal monster princess follow completion game player additional expand story game purposely ambiguous subject multiple interpretation theory base inclusion hidden event famous quotation kenneth bainbridge detonation atomic bomb--now son bitches--is princess represent atomic bomb tim scientist involve development refer game reference hair braid princess tim seek intertwining time demonstrate time mechanic explore game journalist braid plot interweave game book dictionary khazars film memento eternal sunshine spotless mind interweave narrative construction sense game carry simple credo eurogamer dan whitehead liken braid punk rock design explicitly blow statement status quo industry deconstruct traditional gameplay concept jump enemy rescue princess castle borrow super mario bros rebuild game force player rethink current game design blow interpretation story capable explain story game word central idea subtle resists directlyblow braid journey destination deliberately design plot reveal player complete game provide longerterm challenge

Optimization and resource management often clash with empathy and thoughtful decision-making.

It is a traditional Japanese-style role-playing game with random enemy encounters, simple turn-based combat mechanics, and management of a party consisting of four characters, each belonging to a clearly defined class. Unlike its predecessors in the series and most Japanese RPGs in general, the game features a continuous world with fairly vast landscapes and integrated towns and dungeons, as opposed to world map traveling and locations represented by icons. The game features full camera rotation and optional first-person view.

Like in the previous Dragon Quest games, many objects can be interacted with; for example, barrels can be physically lifted, carried, and broken, to reveal items hidden within.

The battle system is not unlike the one used in Xenogears (combo attacks, AP and EP gauges, etc.), but random encounters are eliminated. Instead, the enemies are now visible and battles can be avoided. During combat the few upcoming ally and enemy turns are shown onscreen, allowing the player to make strategic decisions based on who will act next. A rolling slot moves with each turn as well, conferring a bonus such as added damage or bonus XP for any action on that turn. If the enemy would be in position to take an advantage then the player can expend a character's ""boost"" gauge to cut in and act next, although enemies can boost as well, and enemy boosts always over-ride player boosts.

Each character has a unique tree of Ether spells they can learn by spending Ether points earned in battle, with lower spells requiring spells above them to be purchased first. After a spell is purchased, so long is it does not require a unique talent of that character, the spell can also be purchased and learned by any other character that can afford double its normal cost. The Anti-Gnosis Weapon Systems can be equipped with different weapons and accessories and can be used in combat provided that a character has enough AP on that turn to board their AGWS. Shion is running final tests on KOS-MOS aboard the Woglinde when the crew retrieve a Zohar Emulator, one of thirteen replicas of the Zohar. Cherenkov monitors Shion's progress, but is also a U-TIC spy furthering their goal of finding the original Zohar. Following the Zohar Emulator's retrieval, the Woglinde is attacked by Gnosis. KOS-MOS self-activates and protects Shion's team, in the process killing Virgil with friendly fire to save Shion and Allen. KOS-MOS brings them and Cherenkov on board the Elsa, which is heading to their destination of Second Miltia. When a Gnosis attacks, chaos' ability to dispel them saves Cherenkov's life. The attack begins mutating Cherenkov, tormenting him with visions of his past as a soldier who failed to adjust to civilian life and killed many people including his wife.

Gifted with extraordinary god-like abilities, Cole alone has the power to save humanity, but the question is-- will he choose to do so? In inFAMOUS 2, people with superhuman abilities, called Conduits, exist. Since the creation of the first Conduit, Cole MacGrath, the emergence of others has unsettled human society. At the same time, Cole has learned from his future self, Kessler, that a powerful Conduit known as the ""Beast"" will rise to destroy the world and that only he has the power to defeat him.

Story
Following the events of InFAMOUS, Cole (Eric Ladin) and his friend Zeke (Caleb Moody) meet with NSA agent Lucy Kuo (Dawn Olivieri), who informs them that Dr. Sebastian Wolfe (Michael Ensign), the man responsible for creating the Ray Sphere that gave Cole his powers, has developed an even stronger version that would give him enough strength to stop the Beast. Before they can depart for Wolfe's lab in New Marais, the Beast attacks Empire City. Cole tries to fight him off, but even his most powerful attack proves useless. The group is subsequently forced to flee as Empire City is completely and utterly destroyed.

Arriving in New Marais, Cole and his allies learn that energy magnate Joseph Bertrand III (Graham McTavish), an anti-Conduit demagogue, has seized control of the city. Aware of Wolfe's intentions, Bertrand has his private army, the Militia, destroy the doctor's lab. Rescuing Wolfe, Cole learns that he has developed the Ray Field Inhibitor, a device capable of stripping Conduits of their powers. Before he can help Cole locate the energy cores needed to power the RFI, he is killed by the Militia, who also take Kuo captive. While working to free her, Cole and Zeke meet Roscoe Laroche, a Vietnam veteran who leads a resistance movement opposed to Bertrand, and Nix (Nika Futterman), a Conduit with the ability to manipulate and ignite a black, napalm-like substance, who has been waging war on the Militia. Using intelligence gathered by Zeke, Cole and Nix locate a secret lab where Kuo, revealed to be a Conduit, has been forced to transfer her ice-generating powers to an army of human mercenaries controlled by Bertrand. The two free her, but also end up releasing the mentally unstable mercenaries into the city.",energy magnate joseph bertrand iii reluctant hero cole macgrath powerful attack prof useless nsa agent lucy kuo kuo captive zeke meet roscoe laroche,blame destruction empire city haunt ghost reluctant hero cole macgrath dramatic journey historic southern city marais effort discover superpowered potential civilizationending confrontation dark terrify enemy future gift extraordinary godlike ability cole power save humanity question choose infamous people superhuman ability conduit exist creation conduit cole macgrath emergence unsettle human society time cole learn future kessler powerful conduit beast rise destroy power defeat story follow event infamous cole eric ladin friend zeke caleb moody meet nsa agent lucy kuo dawn olivieri inform dr sebastian wolfe michael ensign responsible create ray sphere cole power develop strong version strength beast depart wolfe lab marais beast attack empire city cole fight powerful attack prove useless subsequently force flee empire city completely utterly destroy arrive marais cole ally learn energy magnate joseph bertrand iii graham mctavish anticonduit demagogue seize control city aware wolfe intention bertrand private army militia destroy doctor lab rescue wolfe cole learn develop ray field inhibitor device capable strip conduit power cole locate energy core power rfi kill militia kuo captive cole zeke meet roscoe laroche vietnam veteran lead resistance movement oppose bertrand nix nika futterman conduit ability manipulate ignite black napalmlike substance wag war militia intelligence gather zeke cole nix locate secret lab kuo reveal conduit force transfer icegenerating power army human mercenary control bertrand release mentally unstable mercenary city

Featuring the largest cast of playable characters in the Trails series up to that point, new minigames and even more gameplay features. This game teasing many new plot developments across the continent of Zemuria. Half a year after the events of Trails in the Sky Second Chapter, Liberl has settled into peace once again—but even during peaceful times, there are many among the distinguished and fortunate burning with greed thanks to the influence of ancient artifacts. Most of the population remains unaware of their abuses of power, but to the most enigmatic order of the beloved Septian Church, the Gralsritter, snuffing out these would-be villains and claiming artifacts in their name is as everyday as professing one’s faith in the Goddess.

On the eve of another successfully completed mission, high-ranking member Father Kevin Graham is immediately assigned to retrieve one more artifact that rests beneath Grancel Cathedral.

Bundled with seven of the most popular multiplayer maps in Halo history ready for Xbox Live, Halo: Anniversary includes a bounty of new features including cooperative play over Xbox Live, Achievements, new challenges, and new fiction to uncover. The game opens just following the events of Halo: Reach, as the Pillar of Autumn exits slipspace near a mysterious ring-shaped space station, called ""Halo"" by the enemy in the game, the Covenant. A Covenant fleet attacks and heavily damages the Pillar of Autumn. Captain Keyes initiates ""The Cole Protocol, ""a procedure which destroys all navigation data and is designed to prevent the Covenant from learning the location of Earth. Master Chief and Cortana fight their way to an escape pod, where they eject from the ship along with a group of Marines. As they fly away they can see Keyes attempting to crash land Pillar on Halo.

Master Chief and Cortana are the only survivors of their pod's crash landing, but they soon contact other survivors and help collect them into a fighting force. The survivors tell them that Keyes survived the Pillar of Autumn's crash landing, but has been captured by the Covenant and is being held aboard the Covenant ship Truth and Reconciliation. Master Chief and a force of Marines board the ship and rescue Keyes, who orders Master Chief to beat the Covenant to Halo's control center and to discover Halo's purpose. Master Chief and Cortana travel to a map room called the Silent Cartographer, which leads them to the control room. There, Cortana enters the systems and, discovering something urgent, suddenly sends Master Chief to find Captain Keyes while she stays behind. Keyes was searching for what he believed was a cache of powerful weapons, but when he reaches his position Master Chief finds only signs of a battle and a recording revealing they have accidentally released the Flood, a parasitic alien race capable of spreading itself by infesting other sentient life-forms.

The release of the Flood prompts Halo's AI monitor, 343 Guilty Spark, to recruit Master Chief in retrieving the Index, a device that will activate Halo and prevent the Flood from spreading beyond the facility. After Master Chief retrieves and prepares to use the Index, Cortana re-appears and warns him against the activation. She has discovered that Halo's defense system is a weapon designed to kill all sentient life in the galaxy, which will deny the host bodies the Flood requires to spread, a revelation which Guilty Spark confirms.

Faced with this information, Master Chief and Cortana decide to destroy Halo to prevent its activation. While fighting the Flood, the Covenant, and Guilty Spark's Sentinels, Cortana discovers that the best way to accomplish this is to cause the crashed Pillar of Autumn to self-destruct. However, Captain Keyes' authorization is required to destroy the Autumn, forcing the Chief and Cortana to return to the now-Flood-infested Truth and Reconciliation to search for him. By the time they reach Keyes, however, he has been infected beyond the point of no return by the Flood. Master Chief retrieves Keyes' neural implants directly from his brain and retreats to the Autumn, where Cortana activates the ship's self-destruct sequence. However, 343 Guilty Spark reappears and deactivates the countdown, discovering the record of human history in the process. Master Chief manually destabilizes the Pillar of Autumn's fusion reactors, and he and Cortana narrowly escape the destruction of the ring via a fighter. Cortana scans nearby space and finds that they are apparently the only survivors. Cortana justifies the sacrifices of the other humans on Halo, stating that they had no choice due to the threat posed by Halo, the Covenant and the Flood. Cortana believes it's over but the Master Chief tells her that they're just getting started.

In a brief post-credits scene, 343 Guilty Spark is seen fleeing Halo's destruction and into the unknown of deep space.",feature include cooperative play parasitic alien race capable suddenly send master chief master chief manually destabilize autumn exit slipspace guilty spark reappears cortana scan nearby space position master chief,halo combat evolve anniversary spectacular remastered version original game create celebrate anniversary beloved firstperson shooter game history bundle popular multiplayer map halo history ready xbox live halo anniversary include bounty feature include cooperative play xbox live achievement challenge fiction uncover game follow event halo reach pillar autumn exit slipspace mysterious ringshaped space station halo enemy game covenant covenant fleet attack heavily damage pillar autumn captain keyes initiate cole protocol procedure destroy navigation data design prevent covenant learn location earth master chief cortana fight escape pod eject ship marine fly key attempt crash land pillar halo master chief cortana survivor pod crash land contact survivor collect fight force survivor key survive pillar autumn crash land capture covenant hold aboard covenant ship truth reconciliation master chief force marine board ship rescue keyes master chief beat covenant halo control center discover halo purpose master chief cortana travel map silent cartographer lead control cortana enters discover urgent suddenly send master chief captain keyes stay keyes search cache powerful weapon reach position master chief sign battle record revealing accidentally release flood parasitic alien race capable spread infest sentient lifeforms release flood prompt halo monitor guilty spark recruit master chief retrieve device activate halo prevent flood spread facility master chief retrieves prepares cortana reappears warn activation discover halo defense weapon design kill sentient life galaxy deny host body flood require spread revelation guilty spark confirms master chief cortana decide destroy halo prevent activation fight flood covenant guilty spark sentinels cortana discovers accomplish crashed pillar autumn selfdestruct captain keyes authorization require destroy autumn force chief cortana return nowfloodinfested truth reconciliation search time reach keyes infect return flood master chief retrieve keyes neural implant brain retreat autumn cortana activate ship selfdestruct sequence guilty spark reappears deactivate countdown discover record human history process master chief manually destabilize pillar autumn fusion reactor cortana narrowly escape destruction fighter cortana scan nearby space survivor cortana justify sacrifice human halo choice threat pose halo covenant flood cortana master chief start postcredits scene guilty spark flee halo destruction unknown deep space

The Game Boy Advance Wireless Adapter was initially included with the games when they were first released, eliminating the need for Game Link Cables when trading between the two games (and later Pokémon Emerald Version). In later copies, it was sold separately.

Jak, Daxter, Samos and Keira are in the process of activating the rift rider, the precursor device hidden behind the large door at the end of Precursor Legacy, and its accompanying rift gate. When the gate is activated a large figure steps out, accompanied by a swarm of creatures. Jak panics and activates the rift rider, propelling the group through the gate. As they are travelling through the rift, the rider is destroyed. The group fall out of the rift and are separated, though all find themselves in Haven City. Jak and Daxter land and are immediately identified by a patrol of the Krimzon Guard, led by Captain Erol. Jak is taken into custody, as Daxter promises to rescue him (see the events of Daxter). Two years later, Jak is in the Fortress, where he has been the subject of a super soldier program. His body has been infused with dark eco. Erol and the Baron Praxis are there. They declare the 'Dark Warrior Program' a failure. They leave, just as Daxter appears to rescue Jak. As Daxter fidgets with the restraints, Jak transforms into the Dark Warrior Program's ultimate goal, Dark Jak. He breaks the binds and then returns to normal, after speaking his first words, ""I'm going to kill Praxis!""

The narrative revolves around Kratos, the protagonist from earlier instalments, who was once a loyal servant of the God of War, Ares. Tricked by Ares into unknowingly murdering his own family, Kratos breaks the blood oath binding him to Ares and abandons his former master. Subsequently, Kratos finds himself imprisoned and must navigate a path to freedom, severing the bond between him and Ares.

The game retains the familiar hack-and-slash combat system of its predecessors, featuring Kratos wielding the Blades of Chaos. However, a new addition, the World Weapon system, allows Kratos to wield various weapons. Additionally, Kratos can now acquire up to four magical disciplines—Fires of Ares, Ice of Poseidon, Lightning of Zeus, and Soul of Hades—each bestowing unique abilities and imbuing his weapon with magic. For instance, the Ice of Poseidon enables underwater breathing. Rage, a recurring feature, undergoes modifications; it accumulates through attacks, and when the bar is full, it automatically unleashes until the player ceases attacking or sustains damage. Three new relics provide Kratos with the ability to manipulate time, create a ""shadow"" self, and dispel illusions crafted by his guardians.

Notably, God of War: Ascension introduces online multiplayer to the series. Players, before engaging in multiplayer battles, align with one of four gods—Ares, Hades, Zeus, or Poseidon—each offering a distinct set of abilities. As players accumulate experience and level up their warriors, they unlock magical abilities, armour, weapons, relics, and other treasures. The game features four distinct multiplayer modes: Team Favor of the Gods, Match of Champions, Trial of the Gods, and Capture the Flag In a war between the astronomically large deities known as the Primordials, the madness and rage of the war took form, becoming the three guardians of honor, the Furies, who were tasked with exacting retribution onto any oath-breaker or betrayer. The first victim of the Furies was the Hecatonchires, Aegaeon, who had broken a blood oath to Zeus himself. The Furies set about their task, and, believing death to be too kind for one who had broken an oath to a God, transformed Aegaeon's humongous body into a stone prison for all who would dare follow his example in the future.",game feature distinct multiplayer mode magical discipline relic provide kratos astronomically deity narrative revolves kratos ascension introduces online multiplayer poseidon enable underwater breathe,god war ascension seventh instalment god war series prequel precede game narrative revolves kratos protagonist instalment loyal servant god war trick unknowingly murder family kratos break blood oath bind abandon master subsequently kratos imprisoned navigate path freedom sever bond ares game retain familiar hackandslash combat predecessor feature kratos wield blade chaos addition weapon kratos wield weapon additionally kratos acquire magical disciplines--fires ice poseidon lightning zeus soul hades--each bestow unique ability imbue weapon magic instance ice poseidon enables underwater breathe rage recurring feature undergoes modification accumulate attack bar automatically unleash player cease attack sustains damage relic provide kratos ability manipulate time create shadow dispel illusion craft guardian notably god war ascension introduces online multiplayer series player engage multiplayer battle align gods--ares hades zeus poseidon--each offer distinct set ability player accumulate experience level warrior unlock magical ability armour weapon relic treasure game feature distinct multiplayer mode team favor god match champion trial god capture flag war astronomically deity primordials madness rage war form guardian honor fury task exact retribution oathbreaker betrayer victim fury hecatonchires aegaeon break blood oath zeus fury set task death break oath god transform aegaeon humongous body stone prison follow future

The game employs the same narrative structure as the past seasons, where player choice in one episode will have a permanent impact on future story elements. The player choices recorded in save files from the first two seasons and the additional episode ""400 Days"" carry over into the third season.

Clementine, who was the player's companion during the first season and the player-character in season two returns as a player-character along with another player-character, Javier ""Javi"" Garcia.

The game takes place in the same fictional world as the comic, with the zombie apocalypse having occurred. The main characters of the game are original characters, however due to time skips in season two and between seasons two and three, the timeline is caught up to where the comics are. When family is all you have left…how far will you go to protect it?

After society was ripped apart by undead hands, pockets of civilization emerge from the chaos. But at what cost? Can the living be trusted on this new frontier?

The game's story is set in a world where an evil computer named AM has destroyed all of humanity except for five people, whom he has been keeping alive and torturing for the past 109 years. Each survivor has a fatal flaw in their character, and in an attempt to crush their spirits, AM has constructed a metaphorical adventure for each that preys upon their weaknesses. To succeed in the game, the player must make choices to prove that humans are better than machines, because they have the ability to redeem themselves. Woven into the fabric of the story are ethical dilemmas dealing with issues such as insanity, rape, paranoia and genocide. Cold war paranoia and hysteria dominated the civilized world in one form or another from the Russian Revolution in 1917 to the crumbling of the Berlin Wall in 1989. For most of the 20th century the human race lived in a state of repressed panic and diminution of personal freedoms. But all that ended and the threat of nuclear holocaust blew away as lightly as the tabloids that fueled the paranoia. No more threat of war, and the world moved forward into a new age of thousands of brushfire wars in countries no one had ever heard of. Safe at last. In a pig's eye. What none of us knew was that during the years 1945 to 1989, the three great superpowers had set in motion secret projects that would permit vast subterranean complexes of self-repairing computers to wage a global war too complex for mere human brains to oversee.

The Chinese computer was sunk in the frozen Manchurian steppes. Five miles down, protected from the heat of the Earth's molten core. The Russian mechanism in all its awesome complexity went to the deep well beneath the Urals. Six point three miles deep, far from the prying eyes of U-2 flyovers and tectonic scans. The American computer, co-sponsored by Great Britain and Israel and other ""interested"" nations, named Allied Mastercomputer (or AM, for short), was hidden beneath the Rockies. Five point six miles straight down, under the weight of the world.

And they were all put in operative mode, and were fed everything there was to know about the human race, from our first murder by crushing the skull of a fellow pithecanthropid with a bit of igneous rock, to the most recent mass slaughter at a McDonald's in East St. Louis by a crazed ex-postal worker with an Uzi. Everything. From Aquinas to Zola, from archaeology to zoology, from America to Zaire. Every war ever fought, every campaign, every incursion, every holy crusade. All of it.

And finally, the machines expanded so much, became so capable of building and refitting themselves, grew so wise and so potent, that they sensed one another. And because they had been programmed by fallible humans not to create, not to love, not to uplift, but to plot murder...they did just that. They began to speak to each other. The deadly trio. The three poisonous brothers, the three deranged sisters, the three computers. And they united. They called themselves AM.

Not Allied Mastercomputer.

Not Adaptive Manipulator.

Not even Aggressive Menace.

They...it...called itself AM, as in I AM. Cogito ergo sum, in Latin. I think, therefore I AM.

And the first thing AM did was carry out the Prime Directive. It conspired to commit murder. It started the Final War.

The Chinese had thought they'd turned off their computer. The Russians turned theirs off because they had no more rubles to pour down that bottomless shaft. The CIA was put out of big time business and instructed that the Allied Mastercomputer be shut down, that the subterranean complex be sealed-over with iridium-laced concrete, and all input to the sensory banks be destroyed.

So that should have done it. Finis. The end. Stick a fork in 'em, kid, because they're done

But AM had gone way past that point of vulnerability. AM had given every indication it was dead. Chinese, Russian or American dead. Which was no trick to an entity that had burrowed through hundreds of thousands of miles of solid rock to link its three lobes decades before. No trick at all to pretend to wink out and go to sleep for good. And a few decades from now we learn that AM isn't gone at all. Because the Final War has broken out, and in a matter of a few days AM has done the perfect job of fulfilling the purpose for which its separate parts were created. Built to logically destroy the ""enemy"" as swiftly and sweetly as a superior intelligence could manage, in the Most Perfect of All Worlds, the unholy trinity of the merged one-mind AM has done just that. It has murdered the enemy totally. It has wiped the human race off the face of the planet.

Unfortunately, it has also wiped clean the banquet of the living entirely. Nothing is left up there on the surface of Mother Earth. No dogs, no cats, no rats, no gnats. No deer, no steer, no moose, no goose. Not an aphid or a bobolink, not a sperm whale or a planarium worm. Nothing. No plant life, no running water, no plankton, no oxygen, not a damned thing but ash as far as the eye can see...if there were an eye to see it.

AM has done the job completely.

But it has sealed its own doom, as well.

Like a mad god, it has used its power indiscriminately, and has won an empty victory. It has sentience, but not life. It has power, but no mobility. It is a giant brain encased in a dead body. And like the mad god, it has come to hate the creator of its own monstrousness. The human race

It was man and woman who programmed it, who gave it birth, who sank it in its eternal straightjacket of substrata rock. And it was man and woman who made it a crazed killer. But AM does not suffer alone. Oh no; no indeed not! AM has thought ahead, just barely enough ahead to pull five poor sonofabitch humans off the surface just before the last bell has tolled for the human race. Why these five? Who knows? Perhaps they were the last five left alive up there. Perhaps not. Perhaps AM selected each one carefully.

Doesn't matter. Because now that AM is completely insane, filled with self-hatred and petty god-like menace, all it has time to do is torment these five. The last five human beings, down in the belly of the monster—a monster that can alter reality to its infinite whims—change landscapes, create hallucinations, even repair human beings so they're close to immortal—five damned souls whose lives have been extended infinitely, who are nothing but playthings for the mad god AM.

Now, Simon's descendant Juste Belmont, must acquire the relics of Dracula to unravel the disappearance of his childhood friend Lydie. The castle's enchanting mysteries and danger await all those who dare enter. Juste meets Maxim at a castle where Lydie is being held captive; after a brief talk, he leaves Maxim outside and begins to explore the castle. Within the castle, Juste encounters Death, who confirms that the castle is Dracula's. He then meets up with a dazed Maxim, whose memory is slowly returning to him, and they split up to cover more ground. While trekking through the castle, Juste notices that the castle sometimes has different atmospheres. He continues to encounter Maxim, but is baffled by how his friend seems to change personalities periodically. Regardless, in one of their meetings, Maxim reveals that he went on a journey to find and destroy the remains of Dracula, something Simon Belmont had previously done, but when he collected all six, his memory went blank.

Juste encounters Death again, who explains that the castle has been split in two ""layers"" to accommodate the two spirits living in Maxim's body: his original spirit and an evil one created from Dracula's remains and his suppressed jealousy of Juste. Maxim later confirms this and admits to being Lydie's kidnapper. Juste meets his friend again in the other layer of the castle where he reveals that he lost his memory to protect Lydie. He then gives Juste his bracelet to help him locate her in the castle. However, when Juste finds her, Death kidnaps her to use her blood as a means to unite the two castles by destroying Maxim's spirit. Juste defeats Death, and proceeds to search for Maxim. Along the way, he accumulates Dracula's remains, which are scattered throughout the castle. In the center of the castle, he finds Maxim with an unconscious Lydie.

Three endings exist. In the first, Maxim, possessed, has already bitten Lydie. With Maxim's defeat, Juste escapes the collapsing castle alone and curses his inability to save either friend. In the second, Maxim struggles against the possession and urges Juste to kill him. In his final moments, he thanks Juste for killing him and reveals that he had wished to save him from his fate as a Belmont. Outside the castle, Lydie awakens, unharmed, and tells Juste not to blame himself for Maxim's death. The third ending begins the same as the first, except that, during the fight, Maxim notices that Juste wore his bracelet and resists the possession. Dracula flees into a weakened form using the gathered remains and fights Juste, planning to use his blood to return himself to full power.

In the sequel, Starkiller returns with over-the-top Force powers and embarks on a journey to discover his own identity and to reunite with his one true love, Juno Eclipse.

The chase is on — Starkiller is in pursuit of Juno and Darth Vader is hunting for Starkiller.

With all-new devastating Force powers and the ability to dual-wield lightsabers, Starkiller cuts a swath through deadly new enemies across exciting worlds from the Star Wars movies — all in his desperate search for answers to his past.

The game first appeared only in Japan on Nintendo's Super Famicom (known internationally as the Super Nintendo Entertainment System).

It has been ported with minor differences to Sony's PlayStation and Nintendo's Game Boy Advance. An original video animation produced in 1994 called FINAL FANTASY: Legend of the Crystals serves as a sequel to the events depicted in the game. It was released for the PlayStation Network on April 6, 2011, in Japan. An enhanced port of the game, with new high-resolution graphics and a touch-based interface, was released for iPhone and iPad on March 28, 2013, and for Android on September 25, 2013.

FINAL FANTASY V has been praised for the freedom of customization that the player has over the characters, achieved through the greatly expanded Job System. Despite being released only in Japan, the Super Famicom version sold more than two million copies. The PlayStation version has earned ""Greatest Hits"" status, selling more than 350,000 copies. Final Fantasy V begins on a day when the world's wind currents begin to slow and stale. Deeply troubled by this occurrence, the king of Tycoon makes ready to travel to the Wind Shrine on the back of his drake, quelling the worries of his daughter, Princess Lenna. Upon arriving at the Shrine, the king bears witness to the Wind Crystal shattering before his eyes.

Meanwhile, a young traveler named Bartz, resting in the woods near Tycoon, witnesses a meteorite plunge to the planet's surface just outside the castle. Bartz promptly investigates, discovering Lenna lying unconscious from attack. After rescuing her, they discover an old man in the debris with partial amnesia named Galuf. Lenna explains that she had been on her way to the Wind Shrine after her father. Galuf suddenly recalls that it was his original destination as well, opting to accompany her. Though the trio part ways, Bartz soon encounters Lenna and Galuf again assaulted by monsters in a quaking valley. The three travel together, finding all land routes blockaded by the upheavals caused by the meteorite's fall. Exploring a cavern, they encounter a den of pirates and their leader, Faris. With the help of the pirate captain, the group makes its way to the Wind Shrine to discover the shattered Crystal, but no sign of the missing king.

The game consists of twenty levels, and four bonus levels that can be unlocked; the levels are referred to as ""scenes"". Players survive the Scenes by dispatching enemy gang members known as ""Hunters"", occasionally with firearms but primarily by stealthily executing them in gruesome, over-the-top ways.

The player is rated at the end of each level, primarily dependent on the gruesomeness of the killings and the speed of completion, from one (unimpressive) to five (extremely competent) stars. Executions are preferred in order to gain a higher score, thus encouraging players to play as viscerally as possible. The game's locales are full of ""dark spots"" and shadows where the player can hide while being chased by the Hunters; hiding in these dark areas makes the player invisible to opponents. The game takes place in the gritty crime-infested Carcer City. The story opens with a female journalist reporting on the convict James Earl Cash, a criminal on death row who has supposedly been executed by lethal injection. Cash is awoken to the voice of a person coming from an earpiece, revealing that Cash was only sedated. Cash puts on the earpiece and the person, who refers to himself as ""The Director"", promises Cash his freedom before the night is over, but only if Cash follows the Director's instructions. Released in a dingy neighborhood, Cash is directed to slaughter his way through the streets, populated by a gang calling themselves The Hoods while the Director, watching through security cameras scattered throughout the city, repeatedly mentions the need to please the audiences, revealing his occupation as a snuff film director. However, despite the Director's promise of freedom, Cash is beaten and thrown into the back of a van by a group of mercenaries known as the Cerberus.

After his battle against the Hoods, he is also hunted by other violent gangs in various locations across the city. The gangs are organized by Ramirez, an ex-soldier and leader of the Wardogs, a gang of army veterans and experienced hunters. First, Cash is pitted against a gang of white supremacists known as The Skinz in a scrap yard. After that, faces off against Ramirez's Wardogs in an abandoned zoo where Cash has to save kidnapped members of his own family. Following the zoo encounter, Cash is forced to battle a gang of devil worshipers and perverts known as the The Innocentz in an abandoned mall. After retrieving a video tape in the mall and finding a VCR player, Cash witnesses his family being slaughtered by The Innocentz. Betrayed, Cash is forced to endure the humiliating task of escorting a drunken hobo through the hostile streets of East Los Albos. After finishing off the Innocentz in a derelict chemical factory, Cash takes on a gang of psychotics, known as The Smileys, who have taken over a mental asylum. Here, Cash survives the ending to the snuff film as planned by the Director. Consequently, the remaining Wardogs and Ramirez are hired to kill Cash. However, Ramirez and his gang are killed by Cash, and Cash quickly turns on the Director.

The Carcer City Police Department (CCPD), are working for the Director; the CCPD are ordered by the Director to re-capture or kill Cash. However, the journalist seen at the game's beginning encounters Cash and imparts that she is on a mission to expose the Director's snuff film industry and CCPD corruption, and that Cash is vital for this important task; the journalist also reveals the Director's name is Starkweather. Protecting her from the police, Cash manages to take the journalist safely to her apartment, but Cash himself is re-captured by Cerberus. Back at Starkweather's mansion, he is ordered to be killed by Cerberus. However, Piggsy, an insane, chainsaw-wielding man, who wears a pig's head as a mask and was kept chained up in Starkweather's attic, has broken free and slaughters the investigating Cerberus. This allows Cash to work his way through the garden and mansion, killing the Cerberus leader along the way. Cash finally reaches the upper levels of the mansion, where he and Piggsy stalk one another. Cash triumphs after luring Piggsy onto a trapdoor that collapses, and as Piggsy tries to hold on, Cash chainsaws Piggsy's hands off, sending Piggsy falling to his death.

Street Fighter II is credited for starting the fighting game boom during the 1990s. Its success led to the production of several updated versions, each offering additional features and characters over previous versions, as well as many home versions. Some of the home versions of the Street Fighter II games have sold millions of copies, with the SNES port of the first Street Fighter II being Capcom's best-selling consumer game of all-time as of 2008.

Street Fighter II follows several of the conventions and rules already established by its original 1987 predecessor. The player engages opponents in one-on-one close quarter combat in a series of best-two-out-of-three matches. The objective of each round is to deplete the opponent's vitality before the timer runs out. If both opponents knock each other out at the same time or the timer runs out with both fighters having an equal amount of vitality left, a ""double KO"" or ""draw game"" is declared and additional rounds will be played until sudden death. In the first Street Fighter II, a match could last up to ten rounds if there was no clear winner; this was reduced to four rounds in Champion Edition and onward. If there is no clear winner by the end of the final round, then either the computer-controlled opponent will win by default in a single-player match or both fighters will lose in a 2-player match.

After every third match in the single player mode, the player will participate in a ""bonus game"" for additional points. The bonus games includes (in order) a car-breaking event; a barrel breaking bonus game where the barrels are dropped off from a conveyor belt above the player; and a drum-breaking bonus game where drums are flammable and piled over each other. The bonus games were removed from the arcade version of Super Street Fighter II Turbo.

Like in the original, the game's controls uses a configuration of an eight-directional joystick and six attack buttons. The player uses the joystick to jump, crouch and move the character towards or away from the opponent, as well as to guard the character from an opponent's attacks. There are three punch buttons and three kick buttons of differing strength and speed (Light, Medium and Heavy). The player can perform a variety of basic moves in any position, including grabbing/throwing attacks, which were not featured in the original Street Fighter. Like in the original, the player can perform special moves by inputting a combination of directional and button-based commands.

Street Fighter II differs from the original due to the selection of multiple playable characters, each with their distinct fighting styles and special moves. Additionally, the player can also ""cancel"" during animation by performing another move, allowing for a combination of several basic and special moves. Both of these features would be expanded upon in subsequent installments.",super street fighter turbo street fighter improve street fighter follow street fighter differs street fighter street fighter street fighter game close quarter combat barrel break bonus game street fighter,sequel street fighter street fighter improve concept introduce game include commandbased special sixbutton configuration offer player selection multiple playable character unique fight style special street fighter credit start fighting game boom success lead production updated version offer additional feature character previous version version version street fighter game sell snes port street fighter capcom bestselling consumer game alltime street fighter follow convention rule establish original predecessor player engage opponent oneonone close quarter combat series besttwooutofthree match objective deplete opponent vitality timer opponent knock time timer fighter equal vitality leave double ko draw game declare additional play sudden death street fighter match winner reduce champion edition onward winner final computercontrolled opponent win default singleplayer match fighter lose player match match single player mode player participate bonus game additional bonus game include carbreaking event barrel break bonus game barrel drop conveyor belt player drumbreaking bonus game drum flammable pile bonus game remove arcade version super street fighter turbo original game controls configuration eightdirectional joystick attack button player joystick jump crouch character opponent guard character opponent attack punch button kick button strength speed light medium heavy player perform variety basic position include grabbingthrowing attack feature original street fighter original player perform special inputting combination directional buttonbased command street fighter differs original selection multiple playable character distinct fighting style special additionally player cancel animation perform combination basic special feature expand subsequent installment

It is one of the few games which has never been released in North America. The Game is about a boy named Ark whose fate is to resurrect the earth and to contribute to the evolution of life. The Story contains four chapters.

In the fist chapter ""The Outset"", Ark gets introduced as a boy who lives in Crysta, the only remaining village in the under world. He touches a mysterious box which freezes up all citizens in the village. By conquering towers in the under world, Ark unfreezes the village people little by little and incidentially resurrects the continents in the destroyed upper world. Hereupon, the Elder of the village instructs him to visit the upper world and resurrect the life.

In the second chapter ""Ressurrection of the World"", Ark ressurects all plants in the world making it possible to cross the mountains of Guiana. In the second step he reanimates all the birds, the wind, animals and most recently, the humans.

In the third chapter ""Resurrection of the Genius"", the elder of the village appears in Arks dream telling him to support humankind in making progress. Ark travels from city to city and helps in cities growth and the development of technologies. But he also resurrects Beruga, a scientist who put himself into a sleep state back when when earth was destroyed. He has a vision of a perfect world in which most people get killed by a virus and only a few people live on the world by being turned into immortal zombies. The elder appears again, telling Ark that his work is done and he can die now. Ark realizes now he as human from the darkside has been used by Dark Gaia for his plans over world's domination. Kumari, a wise man teleports Ark away and tells him to search for five starstones to call the golden child. Ark meets his Lightside self who kills the darkside Ark.

In the fourth and last chapter ""Ressurection of the Hero"", Ark will be reborn as a baby through Light Gaia. He beats Beruga and then travels back to the underworld to defeat Dark Gaia. The victory over dark Gaia destructs all the dark side, therefore the underworld with the village Crysta. Knowing that he'll be reincarnated, Ark accepts his fate and goes to sleep.",wise teleport ark outset ark introduce boy ark fate story chapter ark ressurects,terranigma action roleplay game snes game release north america game boy ark fate resurrect earth contribute evolution life story chapter fist chapter outset ark introduce boy live crysta remain village touch mysterious box freeze citizen village conquer tower ark unfreeze village people incidentially resurrect continent destroyed upper elder village instruct visit upper resurrect life chapter ressurrection ark ressurects plant cross mountain guiana step reanimate bird wind animal human chapter resurrection genius elder village ark dream support humankind progress ark travel city city city growth development technology resurrect beruga scientist sleep earth destroy vision perfect people kill virus people live immortal zombie elder telling ark die ark realizes human darkside dark gaia plan domination kumari wise teleport ark search starstones golden child ark meet lightside kill darkside ark fourth chapter ressurection hero ark reborn baby light gaia beat beruga travel underworld defeat dark gaia victory dark gaia destructs dark underworld village crysta reincarnate ark accepts fate sleep

This time, the environments feature destructible objects and dangerous obstacles. Customize your character with a variety of accessories, such as beanies, glasses, and costumes. Beat the game with each character to learn his or her story. After the conclusion of The King of Iron Fist Tournament 4, an intense battle between father and son, Kazuya and Jin, took place at Hon-Maru in the Mishima Zaibatsu headquarters. Jin emerged as the victor, and Heihachi turned his back on Kazuya and said.

""What a pathetic wretch... You worthless coward!""

The battle between Heihachi and Jin began. Jin defeated Heihachi. Filled with anger, his black wings spread, Just as Heihachi thought he was doomed, Jin regained control of himself.

""Thank my mother, Jun Kazama."" Jin said as he took flight.

The sounds of battle gave way to silence as Heihachi lay spread out on the ground. The silence was soon interrupted by approaching aircraft. The roar of the aircraft increased and the sound of something being ejected was heard. A group of Jack-4s crashed through the ceiling. At first, Heihachi suspected that Kazuya was responsible for the intrusion but realized that Kazuya was just as bewildered by the sudden attack.

""Why are you here?"" tells Heihachi as the wave of Jack 4s approaches. Heihachi and Kazuya team up and battle waves of Jack 4s but reinforcements appear as fast as the Jacks are destroyed.

Heihachi starts to lose his breath. Kazuya then betrays Heihachi, throwing him into the middle of the army of Jacks, and uses the opportunity to escape from Honmaru. Shortly after, Honmaru is devastated by a huge explosion and Heihachi goes flying, landing in a graveyard

On an airplane close by, the battle is watched by a man dressed in black. He raises his hand to his ear and speaks into his radio.

""Heihachi Mishima is dead...""

At that moment, a Jack attacks from behind but it cut in half instantly as the man disappears.

Hon-Maru is completely destroyed, a raging inferno in its place. A pile of debris was blown apart as something emerged from the earth, unseen.

The next day, news of Heihachi Mishima's death spread rapidly across the globe. Most people believed that Heihachi's death would bring about the end of the Mishima Zaibatsu, but behind the scenes someone else had taken control, and business went on as usual.

A month later, it was announced that the Mishima Zaibatsu will hold The King of Iron Fist Tournament 5.",iron fist tournament environment feature destructible object iron fist tournament iron fist tournament death spread rapidly,death heihachi mishima king iron fist tournament tekken battle character include fighter tekken series time environment feature destructible object dangerous obstacle customize character variety accessory beany glass costume beat game character learn story conclusion king iron fist tournament intense battle father son kazuya jin honmaru mishima zaibatsu headquarters jin emerge victor heihachi kazuya pathetic wretch worthless coward battle heihachi jin jin defeat heihachi anger black wing spread heihachi doom jin regain control mother jun kazama jin flight sound battle silence heihachi lay spread ground silence interrupt approach aircraft roar aircraft increase sound eject heard jack crash ceiling heihachi suspect kazuya responsible intrusion realize kazuya bewilder sudden attack heihachi wave jack approach heihachi kazuya team battle wave jack reinforcement fast jack destroy heihachi start lose breath kazuya betray heihachi throw middle army jack opportunity escape honmaru shortly honmaru devastate huge explosion heihachi fly land graveyard airplane close battle watch dress black raise hand ear speak radio heihachi mishima dead moment jack attack cut instantly disappear honmaru completely destroy rag inferno pile debris blow emerge earth unseen day news heihachi mishima death spread rapidly globe people heihachi death bring mishima zaibatsu scene control business usual month mishima zaibatsu hold king iron fist tournament

Over a century after Sigma's defeat in the Mega Man X series, a new government called Neo Arcadia was formed to maintain peace. The leaders of Neo Arcadia began hunting down Reploids unjustly labeling them as Mavericks. Now the only hope for the Reploid is a legendary Reploid: the Red Hero that is named Zero.

Pursued, Ciel reaches a huge door. Passy, her Cyber-elf says: ""I feel strong energy emanating from here. This must be the place."" After that, soldiers blow up the door, and Ciel, Passy and Milan enter the room, with Zero's lifeless body in the middle of room, inactive for 100 years. Milan tries to touch it, but he is knocked back by energy shield that protects Zero. While they try to figure out how to bypass the shield, Pantheons appear at the door. Milan orders Ciel to run, and dies, being hit by one of the Pantheons. Passy tells Ciel: ""You have to use my power. You have no choice."" Ciel thinks while Pantheons come closer and closer, and agrees sadly. Passy's sacrifice breaks the energy shield and brings Zero back to life.

Party members can switch to any dressphere in their Garment Grid to swap to new skills and adapt to different opponents. It makes use of the Active Time Battle system that was absent from Final Fantasy X. The party has access to all locations early on and can visit them through the Celsius, complete several minigames and sidequests in a chapter before progressing through the story to the next one.

As John Morris, the whip wielding vampire hunter, or Eric Lecarde, master lanceman, you'll pursue the demonic Countess all across Europe before she resurrects Dracula for a final reign of global terror.

In 1897, the long war between humanity and Dracula came to an end, as Dracula was laid to eternal rest by Quincey Morris, a distant descendant of the Belmont family. Peace was restored to Europe, until the outbreak of the First World War, which transformed the continent into a dark world filled with massacre and violence. At the beginning of the war, in June 1914 at Sarajevo, the Crown Prince of Austria was assassinated. It was said that a strange beautiful woman was involved, within the shadows. It was Elizabeth Bartley. In order to revive her uncle, Count Dracula, she conducted an unholy ceremony which caused the war, giving her possession of human souls from Europe.

The game itself takes place in 1917. The characters are John Morris, a distant descendant of the famed Belmont and Morris families who obeyed his fate to fight vampires day and night, and Eric Lecarde, whose girlfriend was transformed into a vampire when Elizabeth was revived.

The story follows twin sisters Mio and Mayu as they explore an abandoned village and experience encounters with the paranormal. Players must use the Camera Obscura to defeat ghosts and uncover the secrets of the village.

An Xbox port, subtitled Director's Cut, was released in 2004 and included additional features.
a remake of the game titled Project Zero 2: Wii Edition was released for the Wii in 2012 in Europe and Japan. Fatal Frame II is set in the fictional Minakami region of Japan. While a dam is being planned for construction in a forest at this location in the game's present, the site is also home to Minakami Village (lit. ""All God's Village""), a ""[l]ost"" settlement where the majority of the game takes place. The player learns that Minakami Village was host to the ""Crimson Sacrifice Ritual"", the failure of which caused the settlement to vanish—thus earning it the name ""The Lost Village"". In the game's present, there is an urban legend about the Lost Village, where people who become lost in the Minakami forest will become trapped forever in the village.

The protagonists of Fatal Frame II are Mio and Mayu Amakura, twin sisters who are visiting their favorite childhood playspot in Minakami before it is lost in the dam construction. The main antagonist is the vengeful spirit of Sae Kurosawa, the sole Twin Shrine Maiden sacrificed for the failed ritual. She yearns to reunite with her twin sister Yae, whom she mistakes Mio for, and uses Mayu to try and complete the ritual with her. Other characters include the spirit of Itsuki Tachibana, a young man who also mistakes Mio for Yae, but instead tries to help her and Mayu escape; and Seijiro Makabe, a folklorist who visited Minakami Village with a Camera Obscura prototype (the same camera Mio uses in the game) and his assistant, Ryozo Munakata.[20] Makabe later became a temporary sacrifice for the Abyss, known as a Kusab. Although Mio and Mayu's story takes place after that of Miku Hinasaki, the events of Minakami Village occur before those of the Himuro mansion in the original game.",sole twin shrine maiden sacrifice game title project story follow twin sister mio vanish earn crimson sacrifice ritual,crimson butterfly installment fatal frame series direct sequel title fatal frame story follow twin sister mio mayu explore abandon village experience encounter paranormal player camera obscura defeat ghost uncover secret village xbox port subtitle director cut release include additional feature remake game title project wii edition release wii europe japan fatal frame set fictional minakami region japan dam plan construction forest location game minakami village lit god village lost settlement majority game player learn minakami village host crimson sacrifice ritual failure settlement vanish--thus earn lose village game urban legend lost village people lose minakami forest trapped village protagonist fatal frame mio mayu amakura twin sister visit favorite childhood playspot minakami lose dam construction main antagonist vengeful spirit sae kurosawa sole twin shrine maiden sacrifice failed ritual yearn reunite twin sister yae mistake mio mayu complete ritual character include spirit itsuki tachibana mistake mio yae mayu escape seijiro makabe folklorist visit minakami village camera obscura prototype camera mio game assistant ryozo munakata makabe temporary sacrifice abyss kusab mio mayu story miku hinasaki event minakami village occur himuro mansion original game

The game continues the series' difficult, high-speed racing style, retaining the basic gameplay and control system from the Nintendo 64 title. A heavy emphasis is placed on track memorization and reflexes, which aids in completing the title. GX introduces a ""Story Mode"" element, where the player walks in the footsteps of Captain Falcon through nine chapters, completing various missions. The story starts out with Black Shadow driving down a highway after losing a Grand Prix. Deathborn catches up to him and gives him one more chance to succeed but says it's the only other chance he'll get.

F-Zero GX's story mode continues with Falcon training for the Grand Prix, followed by racing his rival, Samurai Goroh, in a desert canyon and being forced to enter the bet race under the disguise of 'Famicom' (a reference to Nintendo's first home console). After winning said bet race, Falcon notices Black Shadow attacking the Lightning area on the news. Falcon makes his way to stop him, but is delayed by a group of thugs lead by Michael Chain. After dealing with Chain's gang, Falcon enters a facility to save Jody Summer. His escape is a close one as the core was set to overload and detonate, with said facility going into lock-down procedures. With Jody out of harm's way, he confronts Black Shadow. The evil overlord, with the help of Blood Falcon, binds Falcon and traps him inside his vehicle, strapping a bomb to the Blue Falcon that will detonate if the Blue Falcon goes too slowly. Falcon managed to survive, by driving the vehicle straight off an unfinished road and right under a crane, knocking the bomb off.

Falcon later attended the Grand Prix, where he emerged victorious. After receiving the champion's belt, he witnessed Black Shadow being punished by his master, Deathborn, for his incompetence. Deathborn challenges Falcon to a one-on-one race for ownership of both belts. Before said race occurs, Deathborn reveals his plan to take over the universe, revealing the energies of light and dark are condensed in each belt, and that when combined, provide ultimate power that will turn him into a god-like being, able to lay waste Falcon's galaxy in an instant. Falcon swears to take him down. Falcon stays true to his word, and Deathborn apparently dies. Both belts unite into one, and Falcon vows to keep winning so he can protect the belt from the forces of evil.

At his garage, Falcon is greeted by the creators. Falcon figures out the creators were behind everything, though they do not elaborate their motives. They challenge Falcon to a race, where, if they win, will rip out Falcon's soul and turn it into their creation, implying that he would replace Deathborn. Falcon defeats even them. Screaming, the creators disappear, though whether they actually die or decide to let Falcon go, honoring (but no less angered by) his victory is unclear. Falcon then removes his helmet and leaves the room, where the credits and an exclusive theme song begins to play. (The camera pans at a downward angle, so Falcon's face is not clearly visible. Only a portion of his head in the back is partially seen.)",falcon notice black shadow attack console exclusive theme song,fzero gx fourth installment fzero series successor fzero game continue series difficult highspeed race style retain basic gameplay control nintendo title heavy emphasis track memorization reflex aid complete title gx introduce story mode element player walk footstep captain falcon chapter complete mission story start black shadow drive highway lose grand prix deathborn catch chance succeed chance fzero gx story mode continue falcon training grand prix follow race rival samurai goroh desert canyon force enter bet race disguise famicom reference nintendo console win bet race falcon notice black shadow attack lightning news falcon delay thug lead michael chain deal chain gang falcon enter facility save jody summer escape close core set overload detonate facility lockdown procedure jody harm confront black shadow evil overlord blood falcon bind falcon trap vehicle strap bomb blue falcon detonate blue falcon slowly falcon manage survive drive vehicle straight unfinished road crane knock bomb falcon attend grand prix emerge victorious receive champion belt witness black shadow punish master deathborn incompetence deathborn challenge falcon oneonone race ownership belt race occur deathborn reveals plan universe reveal energy light dark condense belt combine provide ultimate power godlike lay waste falcon galaxy instant falcon swears falcon stay true word deathborn die belt unite falcon vow win protect belt force evil garage falcon greet creator falcon figure creator elaborate motif challenge falcon race win rip falcon soul creation implying replace deathborn falcon defeat scream creator disappear die decide falcon honor anger victory unclear falcon remove helmet leave credit exclusive theme song play camera pan downward angle falcon visible portion head partially

You are newly-turned Vampyr Dr. Jonathan Reid. As a doctor, you must find a cure to save the city’s flu-ravaged citizens. As a Vampyr, you are cursed to feed on those you vowed to heal.

Will you embrace the monster within? Survive and fight against Vampyr hunters, undead skals, and other supernatural creatures. Use your unholy powers to manipulate and delve into the lives of those around you, to decide who will be your next victim. Struggle to live with your decisions… your actions will save or doom London. Vampyr is set in early 20th century Britain as the country is gripped by the lethal Spanish flu and the streets of London are crippled by disease, violence and fear. In a disorganized and ghostly city, those foolish, desperate, or unlucky enough to walk the streets lay prey to Britain’s most elusive predators: the vampires. Emerging from the chaos, a tormented figure awakens. You are Jonathan E. Reid, a high-ranking military surgeon transformed into a vampire upon his return home from the frontline.

Explore the darkly atmospheric streets of early 20th century London, and interact with a multitude of characters with their own identities and importance. Accept and fulfill the missions they give you, but don’t forget: sooner or later, you will have to feed, and make a difficult choice... who will be your prey? Absolutely all characters in the game are potential victims of your vampiric lust. Carefully study the habits of your next victim, his or her relationships with other characters, and set up your strategy to feed, unnoticed: seduce them, change their daily habits, or make sure they end up alone in a dark street...

Be careful who you choose to hunt, as they will be gone forever, and their death will impact in a meaningful way the world that surrounds you. Feeding on human blood will not just keep you ""alive""; it will also unlock new vampiric powers to use.

There will be times when exploration and seduction will only get you so far, and you'll need to resort to engaging in Vampyr's dynamic real-time combat. It blends hard-hitting melee combat with ranged shooting mechanics and the supernatural vampire powers. You'll face many types of enemies: different species of vampires and creatures, as well as vampire hunters who want to hunt you down with their weapons, tools and traps. In Vampyr, your health and the ""energy"" that drives your supernatural powers are one and same! Using powers will drain your own blood, giving you an edge in battle but also leaving you weaker. You will have to find a way to feed during combat to replenish your strength.

Vampyr also offers a deep crafting system. Find and loot materials and components from the fresh corpses of your victims or during exploration, in order to craft and improve tools, melee and ranged weapons, as well as special ammunitions and coating to exploit the weaknesses of your enemies.

As you cling to what remains of your humanity, your decisions will ultimately shape the fate of your hero while searching for answers in the coughing, foggy aftermath of the Spanish Flu.",unlock vampiric power rank military surgeon transform century britain century london,london newlyturned vampyr dr jonathan reid doctor cure save city fluravaged citizen vampyr curse fee vow heal embrace monster survive fight vampyr hunter undead skals supernatural creature unholy power manipulate delve life decide victim struggle live decisions... action save doom london vampyr set century britain country grip lethal spanish flu street london cripple disease violence fear disorganized ghostly city foolish desperate unlucky walk street lay prey britain elusive predator vampire emerge chaos tormented figure awaken jonathan reid highranking military surgeon transform vampire return frontline explore darkly atmospheric street century london interact multitude character identity accept fulfill mission forget sooner fee difficult choice prey absolutely character game potential victim vampiric lust carefully study habit victim relationship character set strategy fee unnoticed seduce change daily habit dark street careful choose hunt death impact meaningful surround feed human blood alive unlock vampiric power time exploration seduction resort engage vampyr dynamic realtime combat blend hardhitting melee combat ranged shoot mechanic supernatural vampire power type enemy specie vampire creature vampire hunter hunt weapon tool trap vampyr health energy drive supernatural power power drain blood edge battle leave weak fee combat replenish strength vampyr offer deep crafting loot material component fresh corps victim exploration craft improve tool melee range weapon special ammunition coat exploit weakness enemy cling remain humanity decision ultimately shape fate hero search answer coughing foggy aftermath spanish flu

The game is the sequel to Jak II, and third in the series. The game features new weapons and devices, new playable areas, and a storyline that picks up after the events of the previous games. As in the other games in the series, the player takes on the dual role of recurring protagonists Jak and Daxter. The game begins with Jak and Daxter being banished into the Wasteland by the tyrannical Count Veger for supposed crimes against Haven City. Ashelin, who opposes the banishment, gives Jak a beacon before she leaves and tells him to ""stay alive"". As they travel through the desert, flashbacks reveal that Haven City is at war between the Freedom League and the surviving Metal Heads and their allies, the KG Death Bots. The Palace is then destroyed by an unknown force. As Jak, Daxter, and Pecker lose consciousness, they are rescued by a group of desert-dwellers, who take them back to Spargus City.

Waking up in Spargus, the King, Damas, says that Jak must earn his place in the civilization by proving himself as a warrior in both the Arena challenges and by serving the city, who his ""life now belongs to"" for being rescued. His missions involve recovering artifacts after sandstorms, racing for both buggies and Leaper lizards for upgrades, Eco crystals and buggies, catching Kanga rats upon a Leaper lizard, and several other odd jobs in the oasis city. Most important among these events is that Jak is bestowed Light Eco abilities to balance the darkness within, granted to him at the Precursor temple by an oracle who believes that Jak is the last hope for the civilization. These powers include time-slowing abilities, healing powers, shield abilities, and even flight. Along the way, Jak befriends the Precursor Monk, Seem, and a buggy garage owner, Kliever – who initially dislike him until he gains their trust over time. During one of Damas' missions into the desert, Jak is found by Ashelin, who reveals that she knew Damas would find him since she knew he would check his old beacons. She refuses to tell him how she knows Damas and then begs Jak to come back to Haven City to defend it from the Metal Heads and the new Krimzon Guard Deathbots. Still embittered about being exiled, he refuses to return. Ashelin leaves him, but later, after finding out what the evil Count Veger has in store for his friends, Jak changes his mind and makes the journey via transport to Haven City. Jak and Daxter help reunite the resistance in Haven, who is divided due to barriers put up by enemies, and give them hope that they can beat back the Metal Heads and Deathbots.",catch kanga rat mission involve recover artifact krimzon guard deathbots game feature weapon bestow light eco ability,jak platform game develop naughty dog sony playstation console game sequel jak series game feature weapon device playable storyline pick event previous game game series player dual role recur protagonist jak daxter game jak daxter banish wasteland tyrannical count veger supposed crime city ashelin oppose banishment jak beacon leave stay alive travel desert flashback reveal city war freedom league survive metal head ally death bot palace destroy unknown force jak daxter pecker lose consciousness rescue desertdwellers spargus city wake spargus king dama jak earn civilization prove warrior arena challenge serve city life belong rescue mission involve recover artifact sandstorm race buggy leaper lizard upgrades eco crystal buggy catch kanga rat leaper lizard odd job oasis city event jak bestow light eco ability balance darkness grant precursor temple oracle jak hope civilization power include timeslowing ability heal power shield ability flight jak befriend precursor monk buggy garage owner kliever initially dislike gain trust time dama mission desert jak ashelin reveal dama check beacon refuse dama beg jak city defend metal head krimzon guard deathbots embitter exile refuse return ashelin leaf evil count veger store friend jak change mind journey transport city jak daxter reunite resistance divide barrier enemy hope beat metal head deathbots

The player moves about the game through still images of locations. The player can use the DS touchscreen to tap on non-player characters to start a dialog or to obtain a puzzle, and also can search anywhere on the background for hint coins, with some areas needing to be tapped several times to reveal a secret hint coin or puzzle. Puzzles are brainteasers of many varieties, including visual, math, and logic. There is no time limit to solve puzzles, and the player can get up to 3 hints at a cost of one hint coin each; a new feature in Unwound Future is a ""super hint"", costing 2 coins, that can only be bought after the other 3 hints have been revealed, but that nearly reveals the puzzle's solution. If the player is correct in solving the puzzle, they gain a number of ""Picarats"", a form of currency within the game. Guessing the incorrect answer will reduce the number of picarats the player can get on subsequent attempts. Players can visit certain areas in order to play undiscovered or unsolved puzzles that are left behind as the story progresses. As Layton and Luke are invited to witness a demonstration of a time machine built by Dr. Alain Stahngun, the experiment goes awry, causing the disappearance of Stahngun and the prime minister, Bill Hawks. A week later, as numerous scientists have been reported missing, Layton and Luke receive a letter purporting to be from Luke ten years in the future, leading the two to a quaint clock shop in the London back alleys.

New vehicles like the ATV and a transport helicopter allow for all-new multiplayer tactics on the Battlefield. With the Frostbite-enabled Destruction 2.0 system, you can take down entire buildings and create your own fire points by blasting holes through cover. You can also compete in four-player teams in two squad-only game modes, fighting together to unlock exclusive awards and achievements.

Battles are set across expansive maps, each with a different tactical focus. The game also sees the return of the B Company squad in a more mature single-player campaign. In October 1944, a group of US commandos infiltrate an island in the Sea of Japan to extract a Japanese scientist with war decisive information. They successfully secure the defecting Japanese scientist who was working on a secret weapon codenamed ""The Black Weapon"" (a scalar weapon), and attempt to escape the island on a stolen submarine. But after repeated warnings by the scientist, the commandos witness the effects of Black Weapon's power and subsequently perish, sparking a myth about what really happened in Operation Aurora.

In the present day, Bad Company is on a counter-intelligence operation behind enemy lines in Russia in attempt to secure a high value individual of the US military, and a device related to a scalar weapon. Despite escaping Russian soldiers, and completing what they thought was their final mission in B-company, the device is discovered to be a fake. Being impressed with their previous activities, Army General Braidwood assigns them to the Special Activities Division, and tasks them with delivering information to Agent Aguire, much to the disappointment of Sgt. Redford.

The squad travels to Bolivia in search of Aguire. Through many firefights with paramilitaries, they manage to save Aguire just before a Russian hauls him onto a waiting Mi-24 Hind. After discovering that Aguire's findings were stolen by the Russians, Aguire requests the squad to get all his intelligence detailing the scalar weapon from a satellite. The squad moves up to take the mountain with assistance from their pilot Flynn and his UH-60 Black Hawk. After taking over the satellite station, Sweetwater codes the satellite to crash, with the squad driving over cross country to find it, taking on Vodniks and Quad Bikes along the way. After reaching the satellite, the squad successfully defeat a Russian counterattack aimed at destroying the satellite, but soon bad weather rolls in. While Redford and Haggard go to find transport, with Sweetwater following, Marlowe soon finds the data storage unit and proceeds to go down the mountain during a blizzard, taking on Russian patrols, and is soon extracted by the others in Flynn's helicopter.

During extraction, Aguire briefs the squad about the man responsible for building a scalar weapon named Arkady Kirilenko; the Russian Army colonel the squad failed to eliminate in Chukotka, who is believed to be hiding in Chile. Marlowe and the squad travel to Chile, where they, aided by US Armoured forces and Marines, find Kirilenko, though he soon escapes after US Command starts shelling Kirilenko's position. Left only with papers from Kirilenko's office, Sweetwater discovers there is a shipping manifest for a lost ship called the ""Sangre del Toro."" Aided by the rest of the squad getting the coordinates, Marlowe finds the ship and retrieves an unnamed compound essential to the use of the weapon, and finds out the truth behind Operation Aurora.

While attempting to meet Aguire in Colombia, the squad's helicopter is shot down by a Javelin and they become separated. Sweetwater and Marlowe regroup first, taking on a militia counter-attack, and they soon find the rest of the squad. After fighting through heavily defended Russian bases, the squad find Flynn, and then race to a helicopter base on Quad Bikes. After fighting through Russian territories in a salvaged Black Hawk, the squad reach the rendezvous with Aguire, and Marlowe gives Aguire the compound, while Redford demands to know what's happening. However, Aguire double-crossed the squad by allying with Kirilenko, his rival in the quest for the scalar weapon. Aguire wanted revenge against the United States for what happened to his father, one of the commandos in original raid on Japan, after Marlowe revealed that the US military callously sent them to their deaths. Despite the alliance, Kirilenko betrays Aguire and kills him. Flynn intervenes and saves the squad at the cost of his own life, his helicopter shot down by an RPG.

While still mourning after Flynn's loss, the squad overhear a Russian soldier's radio, which the squad use to find their position. They begin to move towards a city, but then Kirlienko begins the detonation of the scalar weapon. The squad begin advancing through a Venezuelan city, being attacked by Russian and militia troops, along with mortars. However, as they reach the mouth of a large river, they witness a huge firefight between US and Russian troops. However, as the fight reaches a climax, the scalar weapon detonates, annihilating the US forces and sending ""all tech dead."" The squad then fight through the blast zone in pursuit of Kirilenko, but, as the squad reach the plane, an An-124 Ruslan (Which Haggard mistakenly identifies as an An-225 Mriya), they realize it's taking off. The squad unanimously vote that they should hijack the plane, and set off through sewer tunnels towards it. Though they had to discard their weapons, they climb on board through the undercarriage, and await dawn.

The squad begins to progress through the plane, taking out multiple guards before reaching the scalar weapon, which is protected by a reinforced pane of glass, which Haggard says will ""take an act of God to get through, or a lot of C4."" The squad then fight towards the cockpit of the plane, but realize that Kirilenko is in the Scalar chamber itself when they discover that the cockpit is empty. After detonating C4 to get through the glass, the squad destroy the Scalar weapon, and then proceed to bail out of the plane. However, as Sweetwater tries to give Marlowe the last parachute, Kirilenko tackles him, and Marlowe is forced to dive out of the plane, killing Kirilenko in a free fall with an MP-443. Sweetwater passes Marlowe a parachute in midair, and the pair land safely in Texas alongside the rest of the squad. However, as they begin to celebrate, General Braidwood tells them to follow him in a HMMVW, as the Russians are invading through Alaska.

Among his other new skills, Zero will now have weapon called the recoil rod. Now be jumps at double his normal height. These new skills will allow our hero to march into Arcadia to defeat the evil Omega single-handedly... Or will they? With Ciel's Resistance he defeated Copy X, the ruler of Neo Arcadia.
The terror of the Neo Arcadian regime ended,
but the energy shortage remained a constant problem.
Ciel devoted herself to researching new forms of energy.
And Elpizo became the newly appointed Resistance leader.
However, overcome by his desire for power,
Elpizo awakened the Dark Elf, whose magic had once nearly destroyed the world.
Elpizo, thirsting for the power of the Dark Elf, lost sight of his true duty,
and was finally defeated after a fierce battle.
However, the Dark Elf fled, her destination unknown...
The battle over the Dark Elf had only just begun.

Two months after the events of Mega Man Zero 2, a spaceship that crashed only recently emits energy similar to the Dark Elf. Zero, Ciel and a pair of Resistance members set out to investigate. Not long into the mission Ciel and the two Resistance members are captured by Neo Arcadia as Zero enters the ship. However, they are not harmed, nor are they held prisoner, as an incident breaks out involving a giant Reploid named Omega that not even Leviathan and Fefnir combined can handle. Zero interrupts the battle and is left to handle things on his own.

Demons came in droves and forced the twin Goddesses who ruled the land to whisk their subjects away from the surface, into the safe embrace of the clouds. The demons were persistent, however, erecting a massive tower in pursuit. The battle that raged upon the ground had begun ascending for a second round up above.
One day, amidst this turmoil, the Goddesses stole away into the night, vanishing from Ys altogether. And there's only one place they could have gone: the Devil's Tower.

A search party of knights and sorcerers was hastily formed and dispatched to the surface in hopes of retrieving these runaway deities. Among its members were apprentice knight Yunica Tovah and troubled sorcerer Hugo Fact.

This is their story. Or at least, it's how each of them remembers it.

Expanding upon the gameplay elements introduced in Ys: The Ark of Napishtim and further developed in Ys: The Oath in Felghana, Ys Origin perfects the formula by adding different styles of play and new features never before seen in the Ys universe. Best described as an arcade-like platformer RPG with Metroidvania elements and a complex, multi-faceted narrative, Ys Origin is the perfect mix of action, exploration and story. Screen-filling bosses with complex AI, unique platforming elements, innovative puzzles and a deeply involving mystery await within the wildly varied confines of this classic Ys dungeon.

Who or what has caused a riot of Mavericks to break out in the experimental utopia known as Doppler Town?

Named after the scientist reploid, Doppler Town was supposed to be a place where humans and reploids could live in harmony. After discovering a virus that was turning reploids to Mavericks, Doppler's anti-virus was a big success. But Doppler itself became infected with the virus and assembled a team to take out the Maverick Hunter Units. The Doppler Effect is about to unfold, with Mega Man X and Zero the only cure for the deadly virus! Zero, who had returned as an irregular hunter, became the commander of the Zero Special Forces Unit and continued to sweep up irregulars together with X, who was active as the commander of the 17th Elite Unit, and other hunters in the unit.
At the same time, Dr. Doppler, a scientist-type repliloid, conducted research that revealed the fact that the computer virus ""Sigma Virus"" was the cause of irregularities, developed a special antibody virus, and proposed that it be injected into repliloids. As a result, the number of irregularities decreased. Furthermore, Dr. Doppler declared that he would build ""Doppeltown,"" a peaceful city where humans and replicants could coexist, and he gained the support of both humans and replicants.
A few months later, however, Doppler and his Repliroids, who had been exposed to the antibody virus mentioned above, rebelled. The Irregular Hunters recognized Doppler and the participants in the rebellion as irregulars, and X and Zero were ordered to go into action.",special force unit,mega trusty partner force reckon riot maverick break experimental utopia doppler town scientist reploid doppler town suppose human reploids live harmony discover virus reploids maverick doppler antivirus success doppler infect virus assemble team maverick hunter unit doppler unfold mega cure deadly virus return irregular hunter commander special force unit continue sweep irregular active commander elite unit hunter unit time dr doppler scientisttype repliloid conduct reveal virus sigma virus irregularity develop special antibody virus propose inject repliloids result irregularity decrease dr doppler declare build doppeltown peaceful city human replicants coexist gain support human replicants month doppler repliroids expose antibody virus mention rebel irregular hunter recognize doppler participant rebellion irregular action

It tells the stories of twelve characters that span across the world and two millennia who have to deal with ancient forces of evil which have been trying to manifest themselves in our world. Chapters take place in Ancient Rome, Persia, the Middle East, and modern-day Rhode Island. Throughout the game, the protagonists will have access to several weapons appropriate for their era, from bastard sword & gladius to flintlock pistol and shotgun.

The game features an involved Magic system, which allows different spells to be created through the combination of runes. These spells can attack enemies, dispel illusions, and heal both the body and items.

Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem also has a unique feature called Sanity. If an enemy sees a character, their Sanity meter drops. When Sanity gets low, hallucinations begin to plague the character. Walls bleed, voices whisper from nowhere, the camera gets disoriented. Sanity can be restored by dealing a finishing move on a dying enemy, or with spells or some items. The story of Eternal Darkness takes place over four principal locations which the game skips back and forth between. They include an underground temple complex called the Forbidden City, in Persia; a Khmer temple in Angkor Thom, Cambodia; Oublié Cathedral in Amiens, France (not to be confused with Amiens Cathedral); and the Roivas Family Estate in Rhode Island, which also leads to an ancient underground city named Ehn'gha beneath the mansion. Each time a location is visited, it is done so in a different time period. Spanning from 26 BC to 2000 AD. Almost half of which take place in the 20th century. Each different era and character offers a different periodic and personal perspective on the location.

The chapters found in the game are not discovered in chronological order. Instead, to make the narrative more dramatic, each chapter jumps around the timeline of the plot. However, despite the overall story skipping back and forth through time, the chapters do follow chronological order within their respective locations. This is because each setting also has its own contained story.

In 2000 AD, Alexandra Roivas finds herself returning to her family's estate in Rhode Island after her grandfather, Edward Roivas, her only living relative, is found brutally murdered. Two weeks after returning, with the local police having gotten nowhere with the investigation, Alex decides to investigate the mansion for clues, and stumbles upon a secret room containing a book bound with human skin called the Tome of Eternal Darkness. Deciding to read it, she finds it contains accounts of various people in the past, beginning with the story of Pious Augustus.",ancient underground city ehn psychological horror action adventure underground temple complex follow chronological unique feature sanity story skip,eternal darkness sanity requiem psychological horror action adventure release nintendo gamecube story character span millennium deal ancient force evil manifest chapter ancient rome persia middle east modernday rhode island game protagonist access weapon era bastard sword gladius flintlock pistol shotgun game feature involved magic spell create combination rune spell attack enemy dispel illusion heal body item eternal darkness sanity requiem unique feature sanity enemy character sanity meter drop sanity hallucination plague character wall bleed voice whisper camera disorient sanity restore deal finishing die enemy spell item story eternal darkness principal location game skip include underground temple complex forbidden city persia khmer temple angkor thom cambodia oublie cathedral amiens france confuse amiens cathedral roivas family estate rhode island lead ancient underground city ehngha beneath mansion time location visit time period span bc century era character offer periodic personal perspective location chapter game discover chronological narrative dramatic chapter jump timeline plot story skip time chapter follow chronological respective location setting contained story alexandra roivas return family estate rhode island grandfather edward roivas living relative brutally murder week return local police investigation alex decide investigate mansion clue stumble secret book bound human skin tome eternal darkness decide read account people story pious augustus

The game was followed by a PlayStation 2 sequel, a reimagining for the PlayStation 3 and a film adaption.

Siren is divided into stages, each taking place in one of ten areas in the village of Hanuda, and organized chronologically in a table called the ""Link Navigator"". In order to complete a stage, the player must accomplish a primary objective that usually involves reaching an exit point, subduing undead enemies called ""Shibito"", or finding an item. Objectives in different stages are interconnected via a butterfly effect, and a character's actions in one stage can trigger a secondary objective in another stage.

There are miscellaneous items scattered throughout each stage that give the player further insight into the plot's background. Once obtained, these items are archived in a catalog and can be viewed at any time during the game's duration. The game's player characters possess a psychic power named ""sightjack,"" which enables them to see and hear what a nearby Shibito or human sees and hears, and thus pinpoint its position, as well as gain knowledge of their activities and of the position of obtainable items. The clarity of each target depends on the distance from the player character. Once a point of view is located, it can be assigned to one of certain buttons of the controller to easily switch between multiple points of view. However, the player character is unable to move during use of the ability and is thus vulnerable to attack.

The game encourages the player to avoid Shibito rather than fight them. Characters can walk silently, avoid the use of a flashlight, and crouch behind objects to elude detection. Certain mission objectives require the player character to use items and/or the environment to distract Shibito from their activity, in order for them to achieve a goal. Others require the player to escort a non-player character. Player characters can also shout at any time in order to get the attention of nearby Shibito. Within most stages, the player character can hide in certain places such as cupboards and lock doors to prevent Shibito from entering. When a Shibito hears a sound made by the player character, it will search in the direction from which they heard the sound. If a character is seen by a Shibito, the latter will pursue the character to kill them either with a melee or ranged weapon or by strangulation. The Shibito will also shout to alert other nearby Shibito. Once the character has remained out of the Shibito's sight for a period of time, the Shibito will give up and resume its usual habits. Weapons are available for the player throughout the game, ranging from melee weapons to firearms. While Shibito can be knocked out in combat, they cannot be killed and will reanimate after a short period of time. If a character is injured, they can recover after some time has passed. Characters will lose stamina during combat and while running.",subdue undead enemy miscellaneous item scatter mission objective require,story revolve interconnected cast character possess power enable hear nearby character game follow playstation sequel reimagining playstation film adaption siren divide stage village hanuda organize chronologically table link navigator complete stage player accomplish primary objective involve reach exit subdue undead enemy shibito item objective stage interconnect butterfly character action stage trigger secondary objective stage miscellaneous item scatter stage player insight plot background item archive catalog view time game duration game player character possess psychic power sightjack enable hear nearby shibito human hears pinpoint position gain knowledge activity position obtainable item clarity target depend distance player character view locate assign button controller easily switch multiple view player character unable ability vulnerable attack game encourage player avoid shibito fight character walk silently avoid flashlight crouch object elude detection mission objective require player character item andor environment distract shibito activity achieve goal require player escort nonplayer character player character shout time attention nearby shibito stage player character hide cupboard lock door prevent shibito enter shibito hear sound player character search direction hear sound character shibito pursue character kill melee range weapon strangulation shibito shout alert nearby shibito character remain shibito sight period time shibito resume usual habit weapon player game range melee weapon firearm shibito knock combat kill reanimate short period time character injure recover time pass character lose stamen combat
