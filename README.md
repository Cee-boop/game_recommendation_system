Experimenting with recommender systems, data extraction and content-based filtering.
___________________________________________________________________________________________
The goal of this project was to build a recommendation system using content-based filtering based on genres and keyword extraction from game summaries. The end result is a web app demoing the final model.

Dataset compiled by me using IGDB and Backloggd.
